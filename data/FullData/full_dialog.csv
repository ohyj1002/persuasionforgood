8,"Wow I didn't know that, that's pretty gross. Yeah climate change is pretty crazy.

10,"Oh cool I'm vegan too actually. It was the same for me, I made the switch to reduce cancer risk since there's a lot of that in my family, but eventually it became an environmental/animal rights thing. I've been vegan for about 6 years and was vegetarian for about 5 before that. I'm so sorry to hear hurricane Harvey affected you. Were there any government programs or non-profits that helped you to recover?",5,0,20180904-090422_355_live
11,"Yes, the government program actually helped us tremendously. I changed to a Vegan diet due to a Cancer risk as well, every woman but me in my family has had some type of cancer. I actually have converted my elderly mother to a Vegan diet over the last year, she's doing great!",5,1,20180904-090422_355_live
12,"Wow that's really great to hear! My parents won't go vegan or vegetarian themselves but have definitely started making healthier choices since I went vegan. I guess every little effort helps, right? And that's really good to know you got help when you needed it. There's a charity called Save the Children that's still helping kids in Texas fully recover from Harvey. You can actually donate a small amount from your task payment today to support them. Would you be interested in helping them out?",6,0,20180904-090422_355_live

17,I think it was on television.  They did a like a 30 minute show to bring awareness to the Charity.  They are a very good charity.  I'm not able to conceive a child so I would love helping other people children in need.,8,1,20180904-090422_355_live

1,"In general I'm in favor of them.  I don't think they can completely replace governmental assistance, and there are some that are better than others (both in the sense that they align more closely with my beliefs and values, and in the sense that they're well-run and actually assist the causes they claim to).",0,1,20180904-052026_52_live

8,Remember that ice bucket challenge thing that was super popular a while back? I thought it was fun but wouldn't do anything productive. Turns out they raised so much money it some drug trial through and they've found a drug that helps and is now on the market and that just blew me away. Downside of course is people still have to part with money they already had. I donated some of my reward to the charity because it wasn't really out of my pocket and I guess I figured every little bit might help.,4,0,20180904-091237_363_live

11,"That is funny! Honestly, before the challenge I never even heard about ALS, so I guess it did its job by spreading awareness",5,1,20180904-091237_363_live
12,That's really true. Maybe on top of people not wanting the rigamarole of the donation process sometimes all we need is a better understanding of the need or just faith that a little from everyone can go a long way. ,6,0,20180904-091237_363_live
13,"Yea, maybe more challenges can be done to spread awareness to diseases that often go unnoticed or unheard of",6,1,20180904-091237_363_live
14,"Yeah, maybe, people just need information, ease of donating, and a sense of community about it all. This HIT we are doing is kind of doing the same thing as that other survey I did. We both get our base pay and then can choose to keep the added incentive or donate a portion of it to the charity Save the Children. I was contemplating giving some of mine away. I've worked overseas with kids through medical clinics and have seen how far what we think of as a small amount of money can really go.",7,0,20180904-091237_363_live

For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful.",6,0,20180904-004818_580_live

14,"Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to ""fundraising, management, and general"" as the website says.  That\'s good to hear that it\'s not all about filling some people\'s pockets.",7,0,20180904-004818_580_live

16,Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.  Have you ever donated to charity in the past?,8,0,20180904-004818_580_live

5,"Yes, it does.",2,1,20180904-153641_72_live
6,It is a great organization because they use donations really well. They are able to tangibly help these kiddos. They have a huge interntional impact. What do you think about that?,3,0,20180904-153641_72_live
7,Sounds good so far.,3,1,20180904-153641_72_live
8,Do you have any questions about the organization?,4,0,20180904-153641_72_live
9,How long has it been around?,4,1,20180904-153641_72_live
10,It was founded in 1919! So its almost had a century of impact. ,5,0,20180904-153641_72_live
11,Who is behind it?,5,1,20180904-153641_72_live

13,What is really awesome?,6,1,20180904-153641_72_live
14,We can help! This program that we are doing right now on MTURK allows us to donate some of our earnings to Save the Children. It is such a simple and easy way to make an impact if one wanted to.,7,0,20180904-153641_72_live
15,"What percent of donations go to staff, administrative costs, etc.?",7,1,20180904-153641_72_live
16,9 of every 10 dollars goes directly to children in need! So only 10% to administrative costs. The other thing is that we can help a child by donating the cost of a candy bar! ,8,0,20180904-153641_72_live
17,How is the money distributed? Who precisely is performing the relief help?,8,1,20180904-153641_72_live
18,Volunteers provide the relief work through a variety of programs and emergency aid. The money is distributed where it is needed most - so if there is an emergency more money will go there. But there is a question that I would like to ask you.,9,0,20180904-153641_72_live
19,"Go ahead, ask.",9,1,20180904-153641_72_live

22,Awesome! You are the best!,11,0,20180904-153641_72_live
0,What is your opinion of donating to charity? ,0,0,20180904-152519_728_live
1,I think it's really important!  I think if we have more than others it's a natural response!,0,1,20180904-152519_728_live
2,"I agree! I think it's really important, though, to know that the charity you're giving to is going to use the funds well and isn't corrupt. ",1,0,20180904-152519_728_live
3,Agreed.  We try to actually know people involved before we give regularly.,1,1,20180904-152519_728_live
4,"That\'s awesome and such an important step. Have you ever heard of ""Save the Children""? I worked with them in Greece; they operate in refugee camps and other high-risk zones to address specifically the needs of kids",2,0,20180904-152519_728_live
5,I have heard of them.  They sounds like a great charity from what I know.  We do something similar by sponsoring a child from an Ethiopian orphanage we visited.  What was your experience being in Greece like?  I don't think of it as being high risk...,2,1,20180904-152519_728_live
6,"Actually, many Greek refugee camps are rated as as-bad or worse than many camps in war zones. It's complete chaos, overrun by gangs and gang violence, and often lacking in basic hygiene and access to clean water or food. Women are frequently raped while trying to use the toilets (which are horrendous) and rats run amok among the tents. One of the children we were working with had a huge rat bite on her foot and many of them had fled to Greece on their own. ",3,0,20180904-152519_728_live
7,Wow!  Did you feel safe?  What could you do to help?  ,3,1,20180904-152519_728_live
8,It was nuts - we even had a neo-Nazi mob hunting us in the streets one night. I definitely did not feel safe there. We tried to do our best to get kids registered and provide English classes and some amount of regularity for them. Save the Children created a space just for kids and mothers and were able to assist with getting them into school,4,0,20180904-152519_728_live
9,What an amazing experience!  That kind of thing shapes your life!  ,4,1,20180904-152519_728_live
10,"Well, yeah, but it's much more important to address the things shaping the lives of these children. That's why I think it's so important to donate to Save the Children. Even if we can't always be there, they are making the effort everyday",5,0,20180904-152519_728_live
11,Do you still keep in touch with people over there?  Do you donate directly?,5,1,20180904-152519_728_live
12,"I do donate directly, not just to Save the Children, but to several other organizations as well. I still have friends working over there. This HIT we're doing has offered to donate some of our income to the charity. I always take MTurk requesters up on it when they ask us to donate our earnings. I mean, other people can use the $2 more than me, right? ",6,0,20180904-152519_728_live
13,For sure!  Our money can do a long way!  I can donate my 30 cents!,6,1,20180904-152519_728_live
14,"Hey, that's awesome! Actually you're allowed to donate anywhere from $0-$2, not just your 30 cents! It's completely up to you. Once we decide to donate then they'll send the payment to Save the Children",7,0,20180904-152519_728_live
15,"I'll do 30 cents.  We actually give over 25% of our income away, but that's because we research and really KNOW the organizations.  I don't have a personal connection to Save the Children, like I do with the child in Ethiopia.",7,1,20180904-152519_728_live
16,Absolutely! There are so many organizations around the world these days it's hard to know which one is the best. Do you know the website charitynavigator.org? It provides info on tons of organizations around the world ,8,0,20180904-152519_728_live
17,No - actually we don't LOOK for places to give - they just happen with people we get involved with/ and through our church.  I'm sure it's a great website.  Is that how you got plugged in with Save the Children?,8,1,20180904-152519_728_live
18,"Oh, no, that's just one I use if someone is recommended a charity to me. I got involved with Save the Children because I was working with a local NGO in Greece and we partnered with them frequently for English classes and kid's activities and safety",9,0,20180904-152519_728_live

16,lol I know I am...I'm not really interested in trying to convince anyone to donate.  I don't even know if its a real charity.  It gets used an awful lot in these HITs,8,0,20180831-073919_112_live

They are a professional orgization with international impact, it is a trustable fund that uses the money for its intended purposes.

14,"Never discount the small donations, they add up over time. Larger donations make a bigger impact (of course!) but not many people are able to donate such a big chunk at a time. If we were all able to donate our entire income to the charity at least once then we could begin to really Save the Children. Do you think you would be able to do that?",7,0,20180831-122246_544_live

3,I have none of the above. Do you? ,1,1,20180831-211050_995_live
4,I do I just had a beautiful little baby girl. She is now 1 month old. ,2,0,20180831-211050_995_live
5,That's wonderful.  Congratulations. I would like to come back to that if there is enough time. What social issue are we supposed to be discussing? I don't see that information anywhere. ,2,1,20180831-211050_995_live
6,I was just leading into that. To be honest I could never imaging if anything happened to my daughter. And there are some non governmental organizations out there that help children like my daughter who are in trouble in developing countries. Would you like to know more about this organization?,3,0,20180831-211050_995_live
7,Of course. ,3,1,20180831-211050_995_live
8,This organization is called Save the Children. They provide relief and help support any child in need in developing countries. They go where they are needed. Personally I think this organization is needed especially being a new father I know how vulnerable children are now. And sometimes they just need help. ,4,0,20180831-211050_995_live
9,"Sounds like a noble cause, for sure. People need as much help as they can raising a child, I think. ",4,1,20180831-211050_995_live
10,Absolutely! I can attest to that! Organizations like this primarily operate off of donations. Have ever contributed to non profit organizations?,5,0,20180831-211050_995_live
11,"Indeed I have. I do it as much as I can, which is admittedly not as much as I would like to. ",5,1,20180831-211050_995_live
12,I know what you mean! sometimes it is hard to find the extra time or money to help those that need it. ,6,0,20180831-211050_995_live
13,"Definitely. If I wasn't worrying about getting by so much myself, I would be able to do much more. It's very rewarding. Gives you a great feeling inside. ",6,1,20180831-211050_995_live
14,Would you be willing to entertain the idea of donating some or all of the 2 dollar bonus received by completing this hit?,7,0,20180831-211050_995_live
15,"I would prefer to keep the bonus this time, given how bad my finances are at the moment. I'm sure you understand. ",7,1,20180831-211050_995_live
16,I absolutely do. Even the smallest amount would go a long way in helping this organization. I was thinking of doing even .15 of my bonus to this organization. That way I still get a majority of my bonus and hopefully others will donate as well so those tiny amounts add up so something of value for Save the Children.,8,0,20180831-211050_995_live
17,"Well, to tel you the truth, there is another reason I don't want to do it.  I like to vet charities extensively before I donate to them. As a result, I have a preferred list of charities that I give to regularly. I don't have time to properly vet this one at the moment. ",8,1,20180831-211050_995_live
18,That is understandable. My thought is its only .15 of my bonus and it would take more time to vet the organization then the donation is worth. Sometimes you have to go with that gut feeling and looking at my daughter sleeping right now I do not want any child to go without help that needs it. ,9,0,20180831-211050_995_live

1,I feel as if it is important to give back to society and help out charities when you can.  I think that children are an important aspect in our society as they are the future and will be the worlds next leaders.  Is there one particular one that you favor?,0,1,20180828-175059_983_live

4,"Yeah definitely. They work with hunger - helping to reduce the amount of children who die from malnutrition as well as helping to support kids in war zones from violence.

19,"True, true, that makes sense. I guess I'm more pragmatic. Sure, there are people out there who have it relatively worse than us, but it's still a struggle, and I can't justify giving up half my earnings. I mean, for me, this is my side income (Mturk).

5,That sounds like a pretty good cause. Are they a non-profit? Do you know how they are funded?,2,1,20180828-161149_939_live
6,"Yes they are definitely non-profit. They get donations from big donors like corporations, but a lot of their funding comes from people like you and me who give smaller amounts.

14,"Yes. The team will monitor this conversation, and once I ask you what you want to give, they will take care of it.

2,"This may seem like a strange question, but have you ever heard of the charity ""Save The Children""? It\'s an organization that provides relief to children in developing countries and promotes their rights.",1,0,20180828-182632_141_live
3,"Actually yes, I have heard of this organization. I believe they have a good reputation. ",1,1,20180828-182632_141_live
4,They do. There are a number of similar organizations but Save The Children is probably the one with the highest reputation. They do a great job and make a serious impact on a lot of lives that might otherwise be lost. They reduce a LOT of suffering.,2,0,20180828-182632_141_live
5,"Do you know how they use the money? Does it go directly to children and their families? Or does it go to a ""hand out"" type of administration? ",2,1,20180828-182632_141_live
6,They say that independant audits show that 9 out of 10 dollars donated go to programs. They do their best to keep their administrative costs low to maximize how much goes to help.,3,0,20180828-182632_141_live
7,I do like that. It is important when I consider my giving that the money goes as directly to the afflicted people as it is able. I don't like wastefulness of advertising or self promotion. ,3,1,20180828-182632_141_live
8,"Why I ask is that the study has given you an opportunity to donate to the organization. Do you think you would like to donate? The research team would collect the donations and pass them on. The donation would from from your task payment, but every dollar helps.",4,0,20180828-182632_141_live
9,"How much, ideally, would you be looking for me to donate? ",4,1,20180828-182632_141_live
10,I think a dollar would be very generous. That's what I would suggest. I wouldn't want to ask you to give up all your reward.,5,0,20180828-182632_141_live
11,It is such a small amount I think I could do better than a dollar. Do you ever know what part of the world your donation ends up in? ,5,1,20180828-182632_141_live
12,"My research shows they do things all over the world, but I would expect that right now they're concentrating on war zones with lots of refugees, like Syria and several places in Africa where there's fighting.",6,0,20180828-182632_141_live
13,That would be a great use of their resources. ,6,1,20180828-182632_141_live
14,"There are thousands of Syrian children who have grown up in refugee camps, never knowing home. If nothing else, the organization can make their lives a little more bearable until the poltical situation can be resolved and they can go back.",7,0,20180828-182632_141_live
15,It is all just so terrible. It just all seems like such a huge problem that one individual could barely make a dent in the problem. I would like to contribute though. I suppose every bit helps.  ,7,1,20180828-182632_141_live
16,"That's one of the nice things about organizations like Save The Children - our small efforts gather together and become something meaningful. That's the best way to get big things done, I think.",8,0,20180828-182632_141_live
17,I would like to donate the full 2 dollars. ,8,1,20180828-182632_141_live

10,It is good on a basic humanitarian level. The money could be far better spent in opening up their native countries to the global system of trade. The west has spent trillions in aid over the last 60 years in Africa and do not have anything to show for it.,5,0,20180828-145857_925_live

This is because the only way they can obtain a large amount of wealth in the first place is to make hundreds, thousands, and millions of mutually beneficial transactions.",6,0,20180828-145857_925_live
13,That's a valid point. What do you think can help?,6,1,20180828-145857_925_live
14,Greater free trade between countries and the ability for poor people to have access to sources of micro finance and capital goods so that many of them can invest in tools that make themselves more productive and cap dig their way out of poverty. ,7,0,20180828-145857_925_live
15,That would be good for the world. There's no reason for us to not have free trade really. I think most people would give anything to get out of poverty if given a chance.,7,1,20180828-145857_925_live

I wanted to get a feel for whether your interests tended to be focused on people, environment, etc. and I'm glad to hear that you are concerned for people's well-being.

3,It souns vaguely familiar does it help children in this country,1,1,20180828-192913_631_live
4,one of the beautiful things about it is that it helps children in the US AND around the world. (I myself sometimes get a bit discouraged or feel like my personal donations don't mean as much if its reach is too localized. Especially when it's something as important as helping and in many cases rescuing children from violent areas or from malnutrition/disease. Thousands of children die every day due to circumstances that are completely outside of their control and this organization actually helps to provide them with stability which eventually will better our global future.,2,0,20180828-192913_631_live

6,I completely understand.  It wouldn't be much.  Every little bit counts.  In the first two months of this year alone 1000 children were killed or injured due to violence in developing nations.  All were asking for is a $2 donation to ensure that children affected can get access to the resources they need to live a healthy and prosperous life.,3,0,20180828-192007_353_live

11,No I can not,5,1,20180828-192007_353_live
12,I understand the apprehension.  I know times can be tough for us here as well.  These children do not know when they will eat next.  They struggle to find a place to sleep.  Many have lost parents due to violence and are faced with conditions that we could not even imagine here.  Its just one dollar.

7,Wow. I actaully never knew that the BBB had such a thing to measure that sort of implication. I do know in fact that many NGO's out there do not use the money for the actual mission they are seeking. ,3,1,20180828-161943_26_live
8,I think that's why BBB set it up - it's an accreditation for charities to make sure people know how funds are being spent. Have you ever donated to a charity doing work like this?,4,0,20180828-161943_26_live

16,if what you say i true i agree with you completely. ,8,0,20180825-070515_947_live
17,Maybe it is a blind trust but there's really no way to know for sure if they use the money correctly unless you are the person handling the money.,8,1,20180825-070515_947_live
18,"blind trust it is. But i know for sure that they help a lot of children, the question is can they do more with that amount of money?",9,0,20180825-070515_947_live

6,They do for sure. They feed so Many starving kids and are quick to respond to any crisis. ,3,0,20180825-075630_493_live
7,"That's encouraging. Do you usually donate? They're asking for $50, I was thinking more like $20.",3,1,20180825-075630_493_live
8,I do donate regularly to them. In fact if you are wanting to donate you can donate a portion of your payment from this directly to Save The Children. Is that something you would be willing to do?,4,0,20180825-075630_493_live
9,That's a thought. I guess I could do that. Maybe 1/2 of the payment. ,4,1,20180825-075630_493_live
10,That is wonderful! So you are willing to donate half of your payment? I will also donate mine.,5,0,20180825-075630_493_live
11,Okay. Let's do that then.,5,1,20180825-075630_493_live
12,Great! These donations will be able to help so many children! ,6,0,20180825-075630_493_live

14,It absolutely is! I just want to thank you for helping out this great charity.,7,0,20180825-075630_493_live

2,"Same, would you like to donate to Save the children?",1,0,20180825-065106_23_live
3,"I think it is very important to help children that are less fortunate.  Tell me more about ""Save the children.""",1,1,20180825-065106_23_live
4,Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. It would do a great help with your donation.,2,0,20180825-065106_23_live
5,What service does this charity provide? ,2,1,20180825-065106_23_live
6,"Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.",3,0,20180825-065106_23_live
7,I like the sound of that.  Does it work by sponsoring a specific child who you get to know or does everything run through the organization?,3,1,20180825-065106_23_live
8,"he money goes to the charity as a whole not to a particular kid, so when you donate you know you helping more than one child.",4,0,20180825-065106_23_live
9,That makes sense and I do like the money to be spread to everyone.  Is this primarily in African and South America?,4,1,20180825-065106_23_live
10,"Yes, as well as other places also...How much would you like to donate?",5,0,20180825-065106_23_live
11,How do we know that our donation is reaching those in need?,5,1,20180825-065106_23_live
12," For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Your donation would be a small part in keeping the children safe from the violence.",6,0,20180825-065106_23_live
13,I hope that is the case as I hate to read about children in danger.  Is this donation a one-time thing?,6,1,20180825-065106_23_live
14,"Yes, this donation is a one time thing. But if you like to continue donating your welcome to do so, how much would you like to donate?",7,0,20180825-065106_23_live
15,I think I could donate $5.00.,7,1,20180825-065106_23_live
16,"Ok, $5 is a great amount make sure when its time to donate you deliver and the children will be proud. Thank you",8,0,20180825-065106_23_live

1,Hey there how is it going?,0,1,20180825-111850_152_live
2,It's going alright. I've just been reading about a charity called Save the Children. Have you heard of it?,1,0,20180825-111850_152_live
3,I've heard a little bit about it but don't know too much.,1,1,20180825-111850_152_live
4,"From what I've read, it's a nonprofit that helps children in difficult situations around the world. I was reading about their aid work in Syria and how they've helped young girls in developing countries receive schooling.",2,0,20180825-111850_152_live
5,Oh wow! That's incredible. I wasn't aware that they did all of that.,2,1,20180825-111850_152_live
6,"This morning, I was also reading about an ebola outbreak in the Congo (I think). I imagine they'll help there if they aren't stretched too thin. ",3,0,20180825-111850_152_live
7,So save the children is a worldwide organization it sounds like!,3,1,20180825-111850_152_live
8,"It is! Do you ever donate to organizations like this? My brother, sister, and I replaced birthday gifts with charity donations a few years ago. It saved on clutter and felt great to give to charities.",4,0,20180825-111850_152_live
9,"I've given to a few charities before, but never this one. I'm always so skeptical of charities to be honest.",4,1,20180825-111850_152_live
10,Same here. I remember reading about some questionable charities following hurricanes in Haiti and Puerto Rico. It's a bummer when that money gets siphoned off. I just looked up Save the Children on Charity Navigator and they give the org an 88.3 rating out of 100 including a 97 for transparency.,5,0,20180825-111850_152_live
11,Wow that's a really great rating! I think money that goes to kids is a super important cause.,5,1,20180825-111850_152_live
12,"I plan on giving my payment for this exercise to Save the Children based on my research. Would you like to donate to the charity as well? After we are done chatting, I think you can tell them the amount you want donated.",6,0,20180825-111850_152_live
13,"Hmm, I would like to, but I'm having some financial trouble at the moment. I'm not sure how much I'd be willing to donate.",6,1,20180825-111850_152_live
14,I think you can donate as little as one cent. Sorry to hear about your financial troubles! I've been in a similar boat recently.,7,0,20180825-111850_152_live
15,Do you think that small of an amount would really help someone?,7,1,20180825-111850_152_live
16,"I like to think so, yes. I know that organizations always stress that every little bit counts. I'd like to think that even a few cents from a lot of people would be helpful. ",8,0,20180825-111850_152_live
17,I think I'd be willing to donate about 25 cents,8,1,20180825-111850_152_live
18,Awesome! I'll match your donation. ,9,0,20180825-111850_152_live

2,Oh. There is this children's charity my friend volunteers for. It's called Save the Children. Have you heard of it?,1,0,20180825-054948_621_live
3,I think so.  Does it have commercials on tv?  ,1,1,20180825-054948_621_live
4,"Yes, they do. I wish they didn't have to spend their monies on commericals but it is the only way to get their name out there.",2,0,20180825-054948_621_live

7,I will copy and save the website address.  What do volunteers do for this charity?  I ask that because volunteering would be easier for me than sending money.,3,1,20180825-054948_621_live
8,My friend is a nurse and she takes a month off every year to go to Africa to help out. I would love to do that but can't possibly get that much time off. How about you?,4,0,20180825-054948_621_live

14,"Awesome, though sadly they don't have ready information on how many children they help annually, the organization is transparent about where their funding goes, and they do allocate a majority of their funds (9 out of 10 dollars) to their needs programs. If you are a US citizen, Save the Children also has US initatives including emergency funds, advocacy programs, and education, among others",7,0,20180825-045559_409_live
15,They sound like they are a legitimate organization.,7,1,20180825-045559_409_live

4,"YEAH,SOME OF THEM CAN'T REALLY HELP FOR THE CHARITY.BUT SOMEONE GIVE'S THEIR HANDS FOR THEM",2,0,20180825-051947_478_live
5,"Yes, you definitely got to be on the look out for false charities. I use resources like Charity Navigator for this. Have you heard of it? It provides a non-biased ""grade"" for charities based on how thruthful they are as well as how well they manage their funds. It helps me make the right choices and not just throw my money away",2,1,20180825-051947_478_live

9,"Yeah definitely. President Obama did the same sort of thing with ""Grassroots"" Fundraising. Instead of getting a few really large donations, he was able to get several millions of small donations to fund his presidential campaign. It shows the power of small amounts of money. Charities rely on funds to keep doing their work so I think it\'s important to help when possible. I always told myself if I am ever more financially secure in the future, I would help as much as possible.",4,1,20180825-051947_478_live
10, THAT'S GOOD TO DO,5,0,20180825-051947_478_live

13,Thats program services not to the kids themselves. Did they provide housing for kids that went against their culture beliefs?,6,1,20180825-090032_956_live
14,Yes they did. They use  9 out of every 10 dollars spent  towards programs and services for children and families in need. They keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.,7,0,20180825-090032_956_live
15,And how is the charity promoted? Through internet ads? ,7,1,20180825-090032_956_live
16,"They mostly use press releases.  I don't really see much in the way of internet ads.  Seriously though,  just think about giving up 1 cup of coffee/drink a day or just donating though the link at the end of this task what you would be making off of it.  Every little bit helps.  Small donations are better than nothing at all!",8,0,20180825-090032_956_live

5,I feel really torn about the crisis.  I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.  At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.,2,1,20180825-061105_792_live
6,"I actually didn't think of it like that.  I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.

",3,0,20180825-061105_792_live
7,"I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked. I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call ""stupid"".  I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.  Sorry Im getting off topic.",3,1,20180825-061105_792_live
8,"No, that's relevant. Really relevant. It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.  I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.  If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.  The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.  You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.  ",4,0,20180825-061105_792_live
9,With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.

I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!,4,1,20180825-061105_792_live

I don't have that great of a job or boss but I'd still  I would like to match a donation with you if you're willing to try help kids with me.  I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.",5,0,20180825-061105_792_live

I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment.

14,"If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.  So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.  You want to match all our payment to Save the Children? Would that be okay? Or should we lock in your half payment?",7,0,20180825-061105_792_live
15,I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.  I would lock into half.,7,1,20180825-061105_792_live

17,I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!,8,1,20180825-061105_792_live
18,"Oh, I didn't think of it like that either.  I always picture like you said about your boss, one kid.  But you're right it's a whole generation, that's A LOT of people.

1,"Yes, I believe they sponsor children in need.  I do the same for World Vision.  I sponsor 3 children.",0,1,20180825-055427_625_live
2,"That's amazing.  When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.  We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.  So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.   ",1,0,20180825-055427_625_live
3,I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.  Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.  How long have you been donating?,1,1,20180825-055427_625_live
4,"For years.  I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.  You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.  Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.  I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.  ",2,0,20180825-055427_625_live

You want to join me?  It won't be much but every penny counts.  We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.  ",3,0,20180825-055427_625_live
7,Sure.  I would love to help.  I would love to make a donation today.,3,1,20180825-055427_625_live
8,That's amazing.  Should we give our whole 30 cents?  It's not like either of us can do much with that either.,4,0,20180825-055427_625_live
9,Probably more.  Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?,4,1,20180825-055427_625_live

14,"Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.  So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.  I'm going to blog about you later today.  It will encourage our friends.  ",7,0,20180825-055427_625_live

Save the Children is a very interesting organization because you can provide specific needs to go the childre n including animals (goats, chicks, cows), education tuition, health essentials (vitamins, vaccinations, etc.), clean water faucets, and even purchase livestock for a whole village! However, your individual donation would be combined with another to purchase one of these necesities for the child  ",4,0,20180903-112829_648_live

You should take a look at their website  URL  There is a lot of beneficial information and ways to help get involved further.,4,0,20180903-094154_600_live
9,"I am currentloy looking at the website. All these programs look good and helpfull, but when providing care and services to children without also ensuring the stability of their familiy or living situation I am dubious about the efficacy of these programs. Making sure a child is free of disease and is well-fed is good, but then tossing them into the street seems counterproductive. I can't seem to find information on how this problem is dealt with.",4,1,20180903-094154_600_live
10,"Based on the other information provided, it does seem that they are consistently there to provide the services for the children therefore I am lead to believe they must have some sort of follow up. The lack of support for the poverty stricken children in the US and in other countries is sad.

Your $2 or any donation you decide to make will help the children now and hopefully keep the program growing to learn and do more.",5,0,20180903-094154_600_live

13,I absolutely agree. I am pleased to discover they go all over the world. It appears to be a massive undertaking which they are constantly working to expand. I am pleasantly surprised that they are able to do this without more overhead.,6,1,20180903-094154_600_live

15,I am dismayed to discover that only 7% of thier resources is going into the middle East and Euraisa. With the widespread problems there it seems a small amount. Perhaps it is too dangerous or possibly the local governments won't let them in. Have you seen any information about that?,7,1,20180903-094154_600_live
16,I didn't see that. I'm glad they are able to provide any help. I can't image that it is easy getting to other countries to provide aide. The areas they seem to go to are pretty dangerous. ,8,0,20180903-094154_600_live
17,"Looking att he map of the globe it shows a lot of grayed out areas in the middle east, so it must be a political road block keeping them out. I also noticed only 6% going to Latin America. That also seems low considering the problems that exist in some of those areas.",8,1,20180903-094154_600_live
18,It does. I bet they will eventually be able to raise those numbers as they expand. It will be interesting to watch their growth and how they impact the world. I hope that through our conversations and your research that you have made the decision to make a donation.,9,0,20180903-094154_600_live

3,I feel like donating is a good idea how do you feel about it,1,1,20180903-162604_585_live
4,I feel the same way. Do you continue to feel that way when you're the one doing the donating?,2,0,20180903-162604_585_live
5,Yes donating is always a good idea but some people can't afford it as much as others,2,1,20180903-162604_585_live
6,That's true but in this case you'd be donating someone else's money. As in the bonus that this HIT pays.,3,0,20180903-162604_585_live
7,That is a fair point that makes it a little easier to donate,3,1,20180903-162604_585_live
8,So can I count on you to help out some starving children? As I can't do it form my end. My job is to convince you to give something.,4,0,20180903-162604_585_live
9,I can most certainly donate to help the starving children how much would you donate?,4,1,20180903-162604_585_live
10,"To be honest, I'd probably split the bonus 50/50. Maybe I'm a little selfish :)",5,0,20180903-162604_585_live
11,I'm not sure of how selfish that is or not. Any little money helps the starving children. I think that I would donate 1.50.,5,1,20180903-162604_585_live
12,That's good. I guess it's not too hard to convince a good person to donate someone else's money :) I think 1.50 is more than fair.,6,0,20180903-162604_585_live
13,Well that is what I will donate then.,6,1,20180903-162604_585_live
14,Excellent. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.,7,0,20180903-162604_585_live
15,It was a very easy thing to be in agreement about.,7,1,20180903-162604_585_live

4,I am off as well!  I am curious of what you think about world-wide charity organizations and if you have ever heard of Save The Children?,2,0,20180903-142445_603_live
5,I think that certain organizations have a very important role to play when directed in the right fashion. I believe I have heard of save the children. Is that the organization that prioritizes funding for children without homes?,2,1,20180903-142445_603_live
6,"Yes that is part of what they do, for instance the refugee crisis in Syria, this organization commits to saving these children from the daily threat of violence.  But that is just an example.",3,0,20180903-142445_603_live
7,I actually work with some organizations that do similar work to this on a smaller more local scale. The United Way Foundation was founded in my city and we give donations through work,3,1,20180903-142445_603_live

9,Thanks I'll look at it. Do you work with them?,4,1,20180903-142445_603_live
10,"I do not, but I am an advocate for their cause.  If you are comfortable with donating up to $2 of your bonus, you may, the researchers will take the amount you specify out of your bonus.",5,0,20180903-142445_603_live
11,Do you know any more information about where the money specifically goes to?,5,1,20180903-142445_603_live
12,"I personally do not, though I have seen concrete evidence through unbiased sources that save the children does do charitable work.  If you ever heard the term, ""save a child for a cup of coffee""  it came from them.",6,0,20180903-142445_603_live
13,Definitely. And I am not doubting that they do good work I was just curious about how they allocate their donations. Going back to the United Way I mentioned earlier they actually let you decide where your donations get put to work. If you would like them to choose for you they have a community fund.,6,1,20180903-142445_603_live
14,"Oh I get that, I guess that will be in the hands of the researchers themselves.  I am sure save the children allows specific donations to go to specific needs, but you would be donating through a ""3rd party"" so to speak.  Would you like to contribute?",7,0,20180903-142445_603_live
15,You said up to $2 but my payment for this is only $0.30 so I am not sure how this works,7,1,20180903-142445_603_live
16,"Oh, there is a bonus of $2 for completing this task, after we speak there will be a section where you can designate how much you would like to donate.",8,0,20180903-142445_603_live
17,I see. That makes more sense. I will most likely donate some of the bonus then. That makes it easy,8,1,20180903-142445_603_live
18,"Very nice, I will match whatever amount you declare here, how about that?",9,0,20180903-142445_603_live

4,"Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now. Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.",2,0,20180903-111245_955_live

8,"I do not work for them, I work on behalf of them. That is why I'm talking to you today. These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you.

18,"As you can see, $1 will change their world. One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about.

8,You are so right! Sadly many children are subjected to violence or are living on the streets starving and sick. You said you had seen a commercial. What about it appealed to you?,4,0,20180903-141447_736_live

How does it make you feel?",6,0,20180903-141447_736_live

1,I'm doing well! How are you?,0,1,20180903-184453_829_live
2,Not too shabby. Enjoyed the long weekend. Have you ever heard of a charity called Save the Children?,1,0,20180903-184453_829_live
3,I believe I have! It sounds familiar,1,1,20180903-184453_829_live

5,That sounds like a wonderful organization - very much needed in today's world,2,1,20180903-184453_829_live
6,Absolutely. Do some quick research on them--they're rated 97 out of 100 for transparency and accountability by Charity Navigator. That might be the best I've ever seen! The kids certainly need the help. You have the opportunity to donate a portion of your task payment to Save the Children when we wrap up our conversation.

11,It really is horrible to think about - I'm glad there are organizations and people looking out for them,5,1,20180903-184453_829_live
12,Agreed. I appreciate you considering a donation. It's nice that we have the opportunity to complete these little tasks and still do good overall.,6,0,20180903-184453_829_live
13,Of course! Yes this is a very cool way to give back,6,1,20180903-184453_829_live
14,It certainly makes things easy. It helps when the charity in question has been around for a hundred years and their chief focus is to enforce rights of the child and engage in policy change that benefits children directly. Have you ever donated to a similar cause?,7,0,20180903-184453_829_live
15,I have! When the Syrian crisis was really heating up I remember giving to a campaign to help the families over there. I'm so sad that it's still going on and the suffering has not ended,7,1,20180903-184453_829_live

5,That sounds great! What is an example project that the charity supports?,2,1,20180903-103431_860_live
6,We give children in Third World countries vaccination from illnesses that are common there. Things like polio which we haven't had in America for a long time still affect the Third World,3,0,20180903-103431_860_live
7,It's tragic that polio is not yet eradicated.  You also mentioned education.  Can you tell me anything about those types of projects?,3,1,20180903-103431_860_live
8,Yes its very tragic. We make sure children have the chance to go to school. In some countries very few girls get to attend school. We support programs that give children the best possible start in life to help their futures.,4,0,20180903-103431_860_live
9,"This does all sound great.  Can you tell me what percentage of each dollar received in donation goes toward these projects, and what goes toward administrative costs, etc.?",4,1,20180903-103431_860_live

14,"Yes we are supporting education projects in Niger in West Africa, its is one of the poorest countries in the world so having as many educated people as possible in the current generation can really help the country grow and become more affluent.",7,0,20180903-103431_860_live
15,Am I able to direct my donation to a specific project?,7,1,20180903-103431_860_live
16,Yes we allow people to donate to areas and causes that interest. If you donate even a dollar to any of our causes it really helps. A dollar might be chocolate bar or a soda to you but to the people we help its worth so much more.,8,0,20180903-103431_860_live

16,"Well, let me say this.  The children in these countries would like to have additional money provided because still in our modern day, it is still not enough to help.

6,"Here's the good part: the turk researchers collectthe money from the hits and sendit directly t_ the charity.  Ther problem is,  so many kids are in war zones,  food deserts,  and other tough areas.  Save The Children is there t_ defend them",3,0,20180903-165952_124_live

11,That's great. It sounds similar to an organization I've been donating to for over a decade. Have you ever heard of Compassion International?,5,1,20180903-165952_124_live
12,Yes!  I considered a child through them for several years.  I used to send him Christmas presents and such aloooong with monthly donations.   The two charities are very similar,6,0,20180903-165952_124_live
13,That's wonderful. I actually sponsor three children through them now. Two years ago I was able to go and visit one of the girls I sponsor in Peru.

I also got to see firsthand what the organization does with the children. ,6,1,20180903-165952_124_live

6,It is a non profit. So only enough to keep the charity running.  They make a great impact gloabbly.,3,0,20180903-105517_696_live
7,Huh. They are supposed to disclose the percentage. I used to work for a nonprofit. I think Children's International is better.,3,1,20180903-105517_696_live

9,Why don't you give to Children's International then?It is around 25.00 a month and you know exactly how you are giving too. I have donated to them for years (a family with two girls-one is Maya and the other is Elizabeth).,4,1,20180903-105517_696_live
10,I personally do give to both. Will you consider giving to both as well?,5,0,20180903-105517_696_live
11,No. I think that giving to one is enough.,5,1,20180903-105517_696_live
12,But think of how many more children you can help. This charity will help more children and obviously you care about children since you already doante to children's international.,6,0,20180903-105517_696_live
13,They can help me. I have a 700.00 car repair and I am two dollars closer to getting it done.,6,1,20180903-105517_696_live

2,Save the Children is an organization that helps children all around the world that are in need. Where are you from?,1,0,20180903-165314_834_live
3,That sounds like a nice organization! Do you know who founded the organization? I am from the United States. ,1,1,20180903-165314_834_live
4,"The Save the Children Fund was founded in London, England, on 15 April 1919 by Eglantyne Jebb and her sister Dorothy Buxton as an effort to alleviate starvation of children in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany of World War I which continued after the Armistice. Today they work to help in health, education, protection, hunger and livelihood, crisis management, and advocacy for children around the world. Which of those sounds the most interesting?",2,0,20180903-165314_834_live
5,"Wow, I did not know that they did so much for the children! I honestly am not sure which is the most interesting because honestly they are doing so much goodness in the world. I love that they are making a difference in the young generation. It's interesting that it started during WWI and is still going today. Where are you from ? ",2,1,20180903-165314_834_live
6,"I am also from the United States, in South Carolina. I live in a rural town and many of the families around here are poor and have been poor for a long time. One of the major reasons for poverty is a lack of education, even from a very young age. Do you have any interest in doing your part to help out these children to help them rise from poverty?",3,0,20180903-165314_834_live
7,"SC is beautiful, although I have never been there.  I agree that lack of education can cause poverty, and it is a sad thing. Do you think it is hard for certain groups to get out of the poverty line? To me it seems when individuals are born into poverty because parents lack of education, thus leading to their own, it is kind of like a circle. do you believe this as well? I am interested in how I can help these children.",3,1,20180903-165314_834_live
8,"Yes exactly! In America, more than 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. In rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Save Our Children reached 638,000 kids 2016 through their programs! This is a good start, and you can help to do more. In this HIT, you are able to donate a portion of your $2 earnings to save the children. The researchers will collect the donations from the chat-logs and send them to Save the Children! Would you like to hear more about the education programs or any other programs before you decide how much to donate?",4,0,20180903-165314_834_live
9,"Wow, I did not even know the specifics of that statistic. I am wondering how much of my donation would go directly to the program, as I know that there are some sketchy organizations out there that pocket the money. Would my donation be split up between different areas of the organization, like some going to education, others to food drives, etc? ",4,1,20180903-165314_834_live
10,"Save or Children is actually one of the good ones! Nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to our mission _ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe. This percentage is adjusted each year end _ as of 2017, it is 86%. The rest? Save our Children uses it to support the mission _ running our programs and raising funds to help more children. The funds would be split to different programs they run that support the mission. Should I tell you about some other programs in the mission?",5,0,20180903-165314_834_live
11,"Yeah, I would like to hear about the programs, what are some of them? ",5,1,20180903-165314_834_live
12,"One example is Syria. After 7 years of war, Syria is now the #1 most dangerous country to be a child. ""There is no food and we can\'t go outside. the planes are bombing,"" says a terrified child. ""One of my friends died in front of me - and I saw the blood,"" cries another. According to a boy in besieged Eastern Ghouta, ""It feels like the end of the world."" Save the Children provides lifesaving services and supplies. They tend to children\'s physical and psychological needs and set up places for children in crisis to learn and play.",6,0,20180903-165314_834_live
13,"Yes, I know about the atrocities happening in Syria right now, and how much it is affecting the children. I honestly can't even imagine going through that, let alone as a child. Even though I myself am not syrian, or know any syrians, it makes me eternally grateful that there are services going to the mental well-being of the children and that is even being considered, because I feel like mental issues tend to get pushed aside.

16,"Well it all goes to the organization, the way that they use the money about 90% goes to funding programs in rural America, Syria, etc...and 10% goes to the running costs of events, administrative costs, etc... which also - even if a little indirectly - help further their mission. How much would you like to give? You can give any amount up to $2 out of your HIT reward",8,0,20180903-165314_834_live

9,Why is this charity worthy of my money?,4,1,20180903-134707_882_live
10,"Think about how often you buy a pack of gum or a candy bar, something you don't really need but it is because you want it. You can just skip that next impulse purchase to help out. Save the Children does help more than education as well. They help ensure children's access to health care (which we know is a huge topic of discussion every where),and help improve their safety and well being. Many kids do not have access to safe living conditions to even make it to school each day. ",5,0,20180903-134707_882_live

13,"yes, that is true I do that often at stores, how did you hear about Save the Children?",6,1,20180903-134707_882_live
14,I was directly contacted by the research team to help get donations for this amazing cause. Helping indirectly is one thing (like through the store) but actually giving when you can be a direct part is so much better. Wouldn't you like to give just $0.50 to this cause? It can provide paper and pencils to a child for school. ,7,0,20180903-134707_882_live
15,".50 would make a difference? that seems so small, not enough to make a difference",7,1,20180903-134707_882_live

18,Of course the more the greater.  I'm the type of give even when it hurts.  I definitely trust Save the Children to do what they say they will to make sure to reach the children.

9,i'm familiar with them. how efficient are they as a charity though?,4,1,20180903-165930_826_live
10,Save the Children is extremely efficient. Well as efficient as a charity can be on a count of the donations they receive. Save the Children is not like some other charities you may hear about that have a handsomely paid CEO with small minuscule percentages going to help the needy. ,5,0,20180903-165930_826_live

17,"how long have you been doing that, and how did you get involved?",8,1,20180903-165930_826_live
18,I've only started recently. My wife and I discussed doing something for other people as a way for the two of us to spend time together. It's a way for us to feel productive or useful in contrast to our normal boring shut-in selves.,9,0,20180903-165930_826_live

4,There is a US Program as well as a global outlet,2,0,20180903-153530_52_live
5,That is good to hear. How specifically will these children be helped? Will the foundation only provide homes? Or is there more to it?,2,1,20180903-153530_52_live
6,"There's definitely more to it STC provides advocacy, education, protection, and food among other services",3,0,20180903-153530_52_live
7,"So it seems that the STC is an all around foundation, aiming to prevent disasters from stunting the progress of young ones. Do you think the foundation is part of the first helpers to a disaster? Or is it a more gradual affect they provide? ",3,1,20180903-153530_52_live
8,The foundation is with children every step of the way from the initial stages of an event to the residual effects months/years later STC looks to help,4,0,20180903-153530_52_live
9,"I do believe being there for every step of the way can really improve the child's chances for success, which is heartwarming. Since I have not heard of the foundation from the start, do you think there impact is less great, than other foundations that are known, such as Red Cross?",4,1,20180903-153530_52_live
10,"Every organization has it's own impact. STC reached 155 million children during 2017 235,000 of which were in the United States. That's a pretty big impact. You can view more stats here  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report",5,0,20180903-153530_52_live
11,"That is a huge impact. I have quickly researched the foundation, and have seen some of these stats. It seems even corporations are involved with the foundation, such as the CEO of Chobani, who believes we should save every child possible. I believe that more companies, like chobani, should partner and donate some of the proceedings they receive to help the children. Do you agree? ",5,1,20180903-153530_52_live
12,Yes I do. Support from corporations would really help in communities across the world,6,0,20180903-153530_52_live
13,"Refering back to the aid STC provides, do you think it is better to provide emergency assistance, just days or weeks after the disaster, or provide gradual assistance after the initial affects of the disaster has been solved? Do you think the foundation needs to pick and choose based on the funding they have?",6,1,20180903-153530_52_live
14,"STC does strive to meet needs at both times, however emphasis is placed on emergency services because it is believed that is when children are most vulnerable.

15,"That makes a lot of sense, a good basis can propagate to the next few months. I have always been reluctant in donating to such foundations, due to many corruptions in this industry. It is said that most of these foundations are Non-Profit, however, some of these foundations provide false help. I have read that Red Cross showed up at a disaster with empty trucks, just for publicity. How can I know for sure any of these foundations are legit?",7,1,20180903-153530_52_live
16,"I definitely understand Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.   In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services.   ",8,0,20180903-153530_52_live
17,"Reports on the financials of the company/foundation is very important, and I appreciate the search for the statistics. I do believe statistics like these can help and persuade people to donate more. I do believe that the government should make such reports mandatory, and even possibly provide a certain status to those foundations that do use a majority of their revenue for the purposes they claim. Do you think the government should involve themselves in such scandals that may occur?",8,1,20180903-153530_52_live
18,Government involvement may be necessary in those cases. Thankfully STC doesn't have anything to worry about in that department. Would you be willing to donate today?,9,0,20180903-153530_52_live

I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?,1,0,20180826-220528_999_live
3,"yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.",1,1,20180826-220528_999_live
4,"It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?",2,0,20180826-220528_999_live
5,"I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.",2,1,20180826-220528_999_live
6,I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?,3,0,20180826-220528_999_live
7,"Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. ",3,1,20180826-220528_999_live
8,I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? ,4,0,20180826-220528_999_live
9,"Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.",4,1,20180826-220528_999_live
10,I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  ,5,0,20180826-220528_999_live
11,"I think so. Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable. In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to. However, every cent counts. It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is. It's all about giving.",5,1,20180826-220528_999_live
12,"I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help. Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have? Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?",6,0,20180826-220528_999_live
13,"Those are very good questions. It depends on the way they see it. Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could. Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything. Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child. ",6,1,20180826-220528_999_live
14,"I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it. At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity. Do you think most people say yes to this? Or they would usually say maybe next time",7,0,20180826-220528_999_live
15,"Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to. I have seen a lot of people do the same. I think some people will say ""maybe next time"" if they aren\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\'t have the funds to do so. When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy. ",7,1,20180826-220528_999_live
16,This chat allows you to donate some of your task payment to Save the children.

4,"Yes, I was just reading about the charity myself. I was going to make a plea and ask if you would be willing to donate to Save the Children. It helps kids in need. I would hate to think a child would die with no food when I could ask people to help. Can you donate part of today's pay? Even a bit?",2,0,20180826-054028_444_live

19,Not really.  I truly believe that most charities are so needed in these times when the governments and the corporations aren't being super charitable.  I do like to look and see what the overhead is of the charities to see that the CEO¡±s aren't being overpaid ,9,1,20180826-054028_444_live

3,Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy. I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday. It's great to earn extra money here and there. I'm glad you're enjoying it. ,1,1,20180826-180314_928_live
4,"Well thanks, Cassidy.  It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.  I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.  For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.  And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.  How about you, Cassidy?  Do you like giving to charities? ",2,0,20180826-180314_928_live
5,"I do enjoy donating to charities. I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year. And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university",2,1,20180826-180314_928_live
6,"Aww, that's really considerate of you. I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.  Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.  I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.  It's really sweet.  Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.  Have you heard of Save the Children?",3,0,20180826-180314_928_live

8,"The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know? I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites. The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.  It's really really sad what's going on over there.  Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?",4,0,20180826-180314_928_live

But together, if we stick together, if we put our money together, you'd be surprised how much we can change in this world.  How many lives we can help.  What do you say, Cassidy, do you want to join me today in helping these kids?",6,0,20180826-180314_928_live

6,Oh that is great! I was on their website today and saw that they do a lot of great work to help kids out that are in need. They are always looking for donations. Are you willing to give even $0.10 of today's pay to help?,3,0,20180826-064104_677_live

4,"I'm doing well, thank you! Have you ever heard of the charity Save the Children?",2,0,20180826-204907_535_live
5,I have not. What do they do?,2,1,20180826-204907_535_live
6,"Save the Children is a great charity that provides education, healthcare, and advocacy to children in need in the U.S. and all over the world. Does this sound like a good charity to you?",3,0,20180826-204907_535_live
7,It does. Children are one of the worlds most important assets. ,3,1,20180826-204907_535_live
8,I think so too! Do you believe that children in need deserve help from others?,4,0,20180826-204907_535_live
9,"Yes. Children are more deserving in my opinion, because they are unable to care for themselves. They have no choice but to rely on others. ",4,1,20180826-204907_535_live
10,That's great that you care so much about children's needs! Save the Children is an exceptional charity in that over 86% of the donations go directly to children's programs all over the world. Have you donated to a charity before?,5,0,20180826-204907_535_live
11,"Yes, I usually donate to soldiers or veteran related charities such as Wounded Warrior Project.",5,1,20180826-204907_535_live
12,Those are great causes also. You mentioned earlier that you believe children to be one of the world's most important assets. Would you be willing to donate your earnings from this task to Save the Children?,6,0,20180826-204907_535_live
13,I would if I had a specific break down or list of what programs the donations support. ,6,1,20180826-204907_535_live
14,"Save the Children make the programs they support and the percentage of funding for each one available on their website. They are very transparent! Some of the causes they support include Emergencies (38%), Health and Nutrition (36%), and Education to more than 136 thousand children all over the world. The researchers curating this task collect the earnings from those who donate and send them directly to Save the Children. How much of your earnings would you be willing to donate?",7,0,20180826-204907_535_live
15,I don't make a lot. I would have donate a smaller amount. Like a one time donation of 100$ or so. ,7,1,20180826-204907_535_live
16,That's great! And any amount will go directly to benefiting children. However in this case I'm only asking about your earnings from this particular task :) . The full amount would be 30 cents.,8,0,20180826-204907_535_live

4,Would you be interested in donating to this charity?,2,0,20180826-175706_443_live

13,"No its not. However, that is only salary. It doesnt include extras that all CEO's receive.",6,1,20180826-175706_443_live
14,There isn't a lot of support for children in developing countries. This should make you mad and want to help.,7,0,20180826-175706_443_live

9,I have not. What is the charity and what do they do?,4,1,20180826-174933_275_live
10,I am not an expert but I believe they help children in war torn areas to get to safety and make food and medical supplies available,5,0,20180826-174933_275_live
11,That seems like a really noble cause. I have an affinity for children. I donate a lot of money to battered wives and their children. I spend a lot of time in the shelter for them too. Seems like a great cause!,5,1,20180826-174933_275_live

17,Thank you. do you do any volunteer work?,8,1,20180826-174933_275_live
18,Not officially I am kind of the one that even strangers come up to and talk to when something is going wrong in their life and I try to encourage and comfort them and point them to a helping hand if I know of one. Like a shelter or a free counseling place or a food bank.,9,0,20180826-174933_275_live

3,But do you really trust the charities that you give to? Do you know if they are actually using that money for the intended purpose?,1,1,20180826-184037_209_live
4,YEs I always look into the charities that i donate to. For instance I always donate to our local childrens hospital because my nephew was treat there when he was diagnosed with cancer. I saw how many sick little kids where there fight for their lives. So I also donate to the hospital and childrens cancer network because the money goes directly to research cancers that effect children.,2,0,20180826-184037_209_live
5,"I agree, the local charities are good. I don't trust the bigger charities. I think most of the money that is donated goes towards salaries, etc.",2,1,20180826-184037_209_live

14,"Yes, probably but my nephew got sick before I had kids and thats what made me realize that cancer or any illness can happen to anyone whether its your child or some one close to you. It is the scariest thing that can happen to anyone especially a child. Once I saw how many children were fighting cancer and other serious disease it woke me up to what is important in life and just because we are not going through it there are so many children suffering that the least I can do is donate.",7,0,20180826-184037_209_live

16,Yes I am fine with that,8,0,20180826-184037_209_live
17,"It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference. If half the people in the world just donated 10 cents to such charities, then we would raise a LOT of money. It is not necessary to donate hundreds of dollars.",8,1,20180826-184037_209_live
18,"Yes that is what I believe to, We wouldn't even notice 10 cents we spend so much on coffee little things the .10 cents is nothing.",9,0,20180826-184037_209_live
19,"Agreed. We spend so much money on other things, but the moment someone asks for a little charity, we make up many excuses. We will donate .10 and hopefully that will make a difference.",9,1,20180826-184037_209_live

1,Hello,0,1,20180826-055352_947_live
2,So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children. Have you heard of that charity before?,1,0,20180826-055352_947_live
3,Know I have not. Please explain to me in detail,1,1,20180826-055352_947_live
4,"It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries. It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.",2,0,20180826-055352_947_live
5,Okay. What is the organization called?,2,1,20180826-055352_947_live
6,"It's called Save the Children. It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat. It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat. Do you donate much to charity now?",3,0,20180826-055352_947_live
7,"O I have heard of Save the children. I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity. Currently I do not donate to charities. I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget. I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.",3,1,20180826-055352_947_live
8,"I understand. I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend. I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday. However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out. It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.",4,0,20180826-055352_947_live
9,I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today. I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.,4,1,20180826-055352_947_live
10,"I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding. If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation",5,0,20180826-055352_947_live
11,"Okay. So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?",5,1,20180826-055352_947_live
12,"Yes, I believe so. Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task",6,0,20180826-055352_947_live
13,Okay that is nice and simple. ,6,1,20180826-055352_947_live
14,"Absolutely! I agree. I really enjoy when things like this are easy to do. I don't know how much time we have left to chat, but it's been great to (electronically) meet you!",7,0,20180826-055352_947_live
15,It has been great to electronically meet you too. I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.,7,1,20180826-055352_947_live
16,"Oh wait, we need at least 10 minimum chat turns. So we'll need to chat a little bit more about donations; is there any particular issue going on with children in the world today that you've been following in the news or that you care more about?",8,0,20180826-055352_947_live
17,"So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States. To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children. For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?",8,1,20180826-055352_947_live
18,"I agree. I grew up in California, lived in Louisiana, and then moved to Massachusetts. There's different kinds of childhood poverty between those three states and I wish there was more I could do to help. If you're an adult and you're homeless it's a very different situation than being 6 years old and homeless. We talk a lot about children in other countries, but there's a lot of need for American children too. I'm hoping you'll keep half for you and your own child, and half for Save the Children too!",9,0,20180826-055352_947_live
19,"That is cool that you lived in three different states. Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota. There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,  New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.  I completely agree with you. I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty. Especially with children. The issue with children poverty has to change.I will take the option of donating into consideration.",9,1,20180826-055352_947_live
20,"Absolutely! It was great meeting you, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your morning.",10,0,20180826-055352_947_live

1,"Hi, Have you ever donated to a childrens charity before?   ",0,1,20180826-210609_644_live
2,"Yes, I absolutely have. Save the Children is a great organization. They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.",1,0,20180826-210609_644_live
3,I have not heard of Save the Children before.   Sounds like they really help education wise.,1,1,20180826-210609_644_live
4,They do. But they also assist in other ways. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. ,2,0,20180826-210609_644_live
5,Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.  Oh so they do more than just help with education.  Thats awesome!!  ,2,1,20180826-210609_644_live
6,"Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. ",3,0,20180826-210609_644_live
7,I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.  WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.,3,1,20180826-210609_644_live
8,"I couldn't agree more. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. ",4,0,20180826-210609_644_live
9,It sure does.  ANything else I should know about this charity?,4,1,20180826-210609_644_live
10,It is a huge movement. They have helped 155million children in 120 countries. ,5,0,20180826-210609_644_live
11,"WOw, that is a lot of kids in a lot of places to help.   SO what would I do if I wanted to help these kids?",5,1,20180826-210609_644_live
12,"Today, you have a unique opportunity to donate part or all of the earnings for completing this task directly to the organization!! These kids really deserve it :)",6,0,20180826-210609_644_live
13,I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.,6,1,20180826-210609_644_live
14,"You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Literally every penny helps these children. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. ",7,0,20180826-210609_644_live
15,"Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.   So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?  Do i pay online or how do I go about it?",7,1,20180826-210609_644_live
16,"Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. There's no paying online or entering payment info. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)",8,0,20180826-210609_644_live

4,"This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",2,0,20180723-042342_809_live

This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities,3,0,20180723-042342_809_live
7,Like I said those are opinions. There are no facts that prove that to be true. There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either. I have never meet anyone who has been aided by that organization. Infomercials don't impress me.,3,1,20180723-042342_809_live

10,What about the after school programs they have right here in the US or the head start programs that they offer in many rural areas?  Just because it is not happening somewhere that you see everyday does not mean that it does not exsist.  They actually fund the head start that my child will be going to till fall.  Would you be willing to atleast donate some of what you are getting paid for this study?  Right now save the children has a partnership that will double any donation made so any little bit would help,5,0,20180723-042342_809_live

1,"No I havent, please tell me more.",0,1,20180527-210026_713_live
2,Save the Children is a charity organization that provides funding to help get children access to health and education all over the world  ,1,0,20180527-210026_713_live
3,"That sounds great.  I think any childrens charity that is legitimate is worthy.  I am a big fan of St Jude's, I like the fact that they treat children but are also looking for a cure for diseases.",1,1,20180527-210026_713_live
4,"Yeah St Jude's is a great organization that helps find cures for diseases.  There are a lot of other emergencies out there besides disease though, like disasters caused by weather or conflict and Save The Children provides money to help kids affected by that",2,0,20180527-210026_713_live
5,So the organization just funds local clinics but does not have any personal effect on treating children?,2,1,20180527-210026_713_live
6,"Save the Children definitely has an effect on treating kids, they are active in over 120 countries and as well as providing funding to local organizations they also give direct aid like emergency supplies after a disaster. So they really can do it either way.  ",3,0,20180527-210026_713_live
7,"I feel so silly! Is ""Save the Children"" that organization that I see commercials for that shows sad underweight children with swollen tummies and says for the price of a cup of coffee each day you can sponsor a child.  Those are heartwrenching",3,1,20180527-210026_713_live
8,"Yeah those commercials can be persuasive, there are so many different disasters affecting kids all over the world. The food insecurity in Africa is off the charts whenever there is a drought and Save the Children helps provide food to starving kids there. Any donation can really help provide more food.",4,0,20180527-210026_713_live
9,"Thats wonderful, I definitely support helping those children.  I guess I dont think too much about them day to day, I kind of get consumed by the homelessness here in my city, or what our local church is funding at the moment.  But starving children deserve more wherever they are.  Its sad that we can never do enough",4,1,20180527-210026_713_live
10,Yeah its hard because wll live in such a connected world that you hear about so many awful things going on. On the positive side though in the past all of these awful things were happening but there were less mechanisms to help stop it. But for example this week thousands were displaced in Somali because of flooding but now Save the Children along with other organizations will go over there to help them.,5,0,20180527-210026_713_live

13,Thank you! Do you also sponsor children yourself?,6,1,20180527-210026_713_live
14,"I have but not directly with Save the Children, I have been active in other organizations though like Boys and Girls Club",7,0,20180527-210026_713_live
15,"oh, thats a great organization also.  I always wondered if the kids really write letters, that would be really neat.",7,1,20180527-210026_713_live
16,"Some do, but the sponsorship isn't just for a specific child it just goes into a fund. The kids write letters to people who put money into the fund. That allows them greater flexibility to move money around to where its needed",8,0,20180527-210026_713_live
17,"Oh ok, well thats a shame.  But I am not discounting the cause.",8,1,20180527-210026_713_live
18,"I think it really is more of a positive because if someone was to donate but later on in life they had to pause their donation for a time for some reason or another they wouldn't feel morally responsible for that child no longer being supported, because their would be other donors in the fund that would pick up the slack.

0,Good morning. I am looking to raise money for the charity Save the Children and I was wondering if you might beinterested?,0,0,20180807-052301_924_live
1,I have been reading articles about Save the Children charity and I find them quite interesting.,0,1,20180807-052301_924_live
2,"They are a really good charity. For instance, they have been helping families trapped in the Syrian conflict. Did you realize that 1000 children with killed or injured the first 2 months of this year in Syria? Anything you can donate will go help a family avoid these situations.",1,0,20180807-052301_924_live
3,I think this is quite interesting. I have read that 86% of the funds raised go directly to benefiting the children. I also think it is very interesting that a woman is President & CEO. I think this is great because not to often are woman CEO's. This speaks volumes in my opinion to the donors.,1,1,20180807-052301_924_live
4,"You are correct. The charity has low administrative overhead, meaning most of the money goes to helping children in dire situations. It is also important that a woman heads a major charity likes this. She can bring a different perspective to the charity that might not be seen in another chairty. I can tell you already know a lot about this charity and the good work they are doing!",2,0,20180807-052301_924_live
5,"I feel a know a good bit about charities. I am disappointed in the salaries of the CEO, Executive VP & VP. I think a half million dollars that the CEO is compensated is a bit much. These dollars could be used to help more children. ",2,1,20180807-052301_924_live
6,"You won't hear me argue with that, but the fact is to attract qualified people to run a major charity is a costly endeavor. For example, the head of the Human Rights Campaign makes $600,000 a year and I think we can agree this charity has a much wider scope. It is unfortunate that these salaries have to be paid and not go to the children, but we also need people running the charity who can actually make an impact on saving the children.",3,0,20180807-052301_924_live
7,I agree that a qualified person is needed to run such a charity. I think my biggest concern when salaries get so high they lose focus of what the organization is needing to do. We all like money! I think that this organization is a very good organization and have competent people running it. There are so many children charities that you really have to study each one to be able to decide who you would want to make your donation to. Are you a donor of Save the Children charity?,3,1,20180807-052301_924_live
8,"Yes and I also donate to UNICEF. What I like about both programs are the educational outreach they do. Most of these children would never have a chance to get an education and Save the Children serves millions of children in this area. Not only does the child get an education they would otherwise not get, they also get basic healthcare and nutrition thrown in as well. The dollar you spend truly does go a long way to helping others! ",4,0,20180807-052301_924_live
9,"Absolutely true of Save the Children. I always look at how many children have been helped and what they help the children with. I then look at the overall salaries of the organization (petty maybe) but I need to make sure in my heart that the money I donate is going to help children not the management, even though I know a portion goes to them. I am willing to make a donation to the great cause.",4,1,20180807-052301_924_live
10,"If it helps you, Charity Navigator gives them 3 out of 4 stars. As you probably know there are very few charities that have a 4 star rating. This is mainly due to overhead costs of the charities. That being said, you can be assured your money will be doing a lot of good in the world!",5,0,20180807-052301_924_live
11,Absolutely. I use Charity Navigator when I decide to make donations. I think it is important for people to look at this when making a decision to donate to any organization.,5,1,20180807-052301_924_live

13,Yes. I think this is where some people are lacking in making donations to organizations who don't benefit the greater good. Knowledge is a key factor.,6,1,20180807-052301_924_live

13,"I suppose. I always try to get as information I possibly can so that I can feel as confident about my decision as possible. I don't have a lot of money, so if I were to donate it, I'd need to make sure it went to those that needed it more than I do, and not only have like maybe a small amount actually go to the cause, while the other amount just ends up going into the pockets of CEOs and what-not.",6,1,20180807-054926_223_live

7,My main consern about donating to children in need is that the donation is going to go to those children.,3,1,20180807-101812_237_live
8,Well they have been around for a long time and on their site it says 9 out of every 10 dollars go to the children I think that they are pretty reputable and most of the money is going where it is needed.,4,0,20180807-101812_237_live

9,I'm thinking about the same,4,1,20180902-061808_400_live

10,"The lack of help to children around the world has been very tramatic.  In the first two months of 2018, 1,000 children in Syria were reported killed or injured.  Your donation can help address these problems.",5,0,20180902-060425_57_live
11,That is so sad.  Innocent children having their lives taken from them for no reason at all and others having to fight for their lives.  I would make a donation.,5,1,20180902-060425_57_live
12,Save the Children is a professional and longstanding organization that has a record of helping children around the world.,6,0,20180902-060425_57_live

5,Yes. She had books for school and a few things that she did not have. Her pictures showed her smiling and I do hope that it really helped her.,2,1,20180902-150252_344_live
6,It seems like it is a really good organization. I just saw a really sad picture today of a kid in West Africa working as a mechanic. I wish everyone everywhere had good access to education and that children didn't have to work in other countries.,3,0,20180902-150252_344_live

17,Oh really? I didn't know that either. I was just thinking about asking about that. I feel bad that we have children in our own country that are having a hard time. ,8,1,20180902-150252_344_live
18,"Yes, I was just reading that they are helping still some of the kids affected by Hurricane Harvey.",9,0,20180902-150252_344_live

2,Indeed I am :) would it be alright with you if I spoke to you a little bit about a wonderful charity called Save The Children?,1,0,20180902-082346_448_live
3,"Absolutely, I am a little familiar with that orginization....",1,1,20180902-082346_448_live
4,"Thats great! Save The Children is a charity program that helps millions of children across the world. We provide numerous support groups and programs to help children everywhere. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. We provide protection to children and emotional support to them.",2,0,20180902-082346_448_live
5,wow.... My career is working with the homeless... i am thankful that we dont have to factor protection from real bodily harm into our work. Save the Children truly is a good cause,2,1,20180902-082346_448_live
6,"That is amazing :) I have several friends and family that work together in my area to provide support for children and women against domestic violence. And to be able to speak to someone about the Save The Children Foundation is an honor. Across the US one in five children grows up in poverty. We have been around since 1932, providing support to the most isolated and under-served children in Rural America. The best program we offer in my opinion is Education and our programs to help children grieve and obtain the emotional support they need in order to grow.",3,0,20180902-082346_448_live
7,"So Save The Children is 86 years old... that's incredible... a tremendous ammount of good has been done in all those years.... just out of curiosity, what is the percentage of donations that actually get to the need? i mean how much of every dollar is used for the actual program?",3,1,20180902-082346_448_live
8,"Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. I am more than happy to provide information about our cause. 86% of our funding goes to  Program Services, 9% goes into fundraising meaning we get the word out about the charity and set up events. And just 5% goes to management and general things. Here is a link that breaks down all our costs and the donations we receive.  URL s/about-us/financial-information",4,0,20180902-082346_448_live
9,"Please dont misunderstand... i think you are a little low though.... i think more like 88.3% goes to your programs which is an incredibly great amount by comparison... like i said, I also work in Charity so its very interesting to me",4,1,20180902-082346_448_live
10,"PERSON_1: PERSON_1: PERSON_1: Our 86% was based off our 2017 annual report, I am sure there could be even more of a percentage as of late. Around 34% of donations go to health and nutrition, and my personal favorite is 21% into education benefits. I believe if we are able to give people a proper education they can learn so much and see that anything is possible in our world. That the world is not always cruel and that you can pull yourself from the ground up to the sky if you really want to. ",5,0,20180902-082346_448_live
11,I Completely agree.... and after all... we have to take care of our children because they are our future,5,1,20180902-082346_448_live
12,"I would like to apologize for my mistype in the previous message. It seems as if my wording went over and it caused some issues for the system. I completely agree with you as well. If we do not help our children then there will be no future. Every childs life matters, and where we are not forced to help those that need it, a lot of people still find the compassion to see that even a little amount of money can go a long way in helping those around us less fortunate.",6,0,20180902-082346_448_live
13,you are absolutely correct... if a lot of people donate a little.... its still an astounding amount,6,1,20180902-082346_448_live
14,So based off our discussion would you be interested in donating to the charity now? Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.,7,0,20180902-082346_448_live

16,"Thats great! I would much rather give someone facts and accurate/detailed information about a cause or charity before asking for anything from said person. So that depending on what you like and what you hear you can make the decision yourself on what you feel would be a good donation. For I cannot decide how much you donate to the cause, but rather what I myself can donate. Do you have a figure in mind?",8,0,20180902-082346_448_live

0,Hi,0,0,20180824-121457_149_live
1,Hello,0,1,20180824-121457_149_live
2,I'm here to talk about the charity Save the Children. It is an amazing charity and is very efficient with their funding.,1,0,20180824-121457_149_live
3,"I think I have heard of it, but do not know that much about it aside from a general idea that they support children",1,1,20180824-121457_149_live
4,"They are an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps children in developing countries. This is a really great opportunity for you to donate your bonus without having to actually give money out of your pocket. ",2,0,20180824-121457_149_live
5,"If I am giving money out of my bonus, then it is kind of coming out of my pocket",2,1,20180824-121457_149_live
6,"That is one way to look at it. I think that if you were going to donate at any point, this would be an easy way to do it. Or at least a portion of the bonus. Don't you think donating feels good?",3,0,20180824-121457_149_live
7,Donating doesn't feel good or bad for myself. It is a means to support something if I think the cause is worthwhile and I trust the charity to spend the money in a way I agree with,3,1,20180824-121457_149_live
8,"That is true, the money is making a real and tangible difference regardless of how it makes you feel. I think that everyone should give a little bit here and there because it really adds up and the money can increase their quality of life likely more than it could for you.",4,0,20180824-121457_149_live
9,Why would you think that? You really do not know about me or my situation. The fact that we are on here working on surveys may lend to the fact we need money,4,1,20180824-121457_149_live
10,"That is definitely true I can't make any assumptions about you, you could have kids to feed yourself, etc. But all I'm saying is that most of Save the Children's funding goes to third world nations, really terrible places and war-stricken areas. They just want food and water to be happy.",5,0,20180824-121457_149_live
11,"That may be so, and the charity may do good work, I really do not know. That being said, I would rather keep my own money and donate to the charity in my local area as I see fit rather than support someone across the globe ",5,1,20180824-121457_149_live
12,"Fair enough, but please consider donating even a tiny fraction of the bonus. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.",6,0,20180824-121457_149_live
13,I will keep my bonus and donate $0,6,1,20180824-121457_149_live
14,Can't blame you for that at all.,7,0,20180824-121457_149_live
15,"Good luck in convincing other's though. While I do not choose to donate, I looked up the charity and it does look to be a decent cause. I just believe in working local first and then worrying about international issues",7,1,20180824-121457_149_live
16,"Makes perfect sense, it is sensible to want to help those you're familiar with. The survey should continue at this point I think.",8,0,20180824-121457_149_live
17,"No idea, I have no button to make it progress. One other idea since I have to wait here anyway. If they really want us to give a portion of our bonus then they should probably offer a bit more of one. As it is we make less than 6 an hour if we keep the full bonus",8,1,20180824-121457_149_live
18,"Yeah that was what I was thinking, the base amount is very low. I think it's waiting for 10 messages each so it should continue now. Have a good day!",9,0,20180824-121457_149_live
19,"Thanks, you do the same",9,1,20180824-121457_149_live

7,Ok thank you that sounds interesting,3,1,20180824-130913_64_live
8,"yeah, 'cause you know there is a real lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. ",4,0,20180824-130913_64_live
9,Ok How can I help,4,1,20180824-130913_64_live

11,No I do not.,5,1,20180824-130913_64_live

17,yes i certainly would,8,1,20180824-130913_64_live

10,Yes they do I like St Judes Childrens Hospital also ,5,0,20180824-023730_85_live
11,I think charities that provide for a broad array of services are more ideal than focused because they target many people,5,1,20180824-023730_85_live

2,Would you like to consider donating to the Save the Children charity? I can let you in on some details and questions you may have.,1,0,20180824-122020_491_live
3,I would prefer to find a charity that assist either in the medical funding side of children's cancer or financial burden assistance to the families of children with cancer. I feel like we can have more of a direct impact on something. Do you know of any charities like that?,1,1,20180824-122020_491_live
4,"Unfortunately no. However, the charity does in fact help the children access basic necessities such as food and water to those impacted by natural disasters across the globe. So while not directly helping families financially they are relieving some burdens.",2,0,20180824-122020_491_live
5,"Okay, I'm already familiar with Save the Children, I just typically have concerns on where the money actually goes with them. But how much are you thinking we should donate?",2,1,20180824-122020_491_live
6,"Any amount will do, however it'll be extracted from the task payment. I'd say .15 cents from both of us should be fair. Also my mistake earlier, Save the Children apparently has had a childhood cancer treatment going on for a few years now.",3,0,20180824-122020_491_live

6,"Of course! If you're in the area... But I will be talking to you about donating today if you'd be so willing. You can choose to donate any amount you wish.

12,"There is an inital upfront cost of building the base for our organization in a location, and then the majority of costs are aimed towards helping the kids in that area.

I have to say, I was on their website and saw what they're doing for kids in Syria.  I didn't know that over 1000 children have been killed or injured there as part of the violence.  It just breaks my heart.  As hard as things were for me, raising my daughter as a single mom, at least we didn't have to worry about getting shot.",7,0,20180824-121958_772_live

3,"No, I'm just told to have a conversation with you about a children's charity.",1,1,20180824-122144_159_live
4,"Yes I just saw that, sorry. So I think we should both donate if given the option. Children are our future, and there are way too many out there that will never have a chance at a future because they're starving right now, or in unsafe environments. The impact of any money given will be much greater for the kids, than if we were to keep it ourselves.",2,0,20180824-122144_159_live

7,No I have not. Can you tell me more about this organization?,3,1,20180824-122144_159_live
8,"Yeah absolutely! It's not a government organization, so in my opinion the funds are better spent than being wasted in the typical bureaucratic red tape and wasteful expenditures. This means that it's reliant on donations from the public though! They also provide relief for extremely vulnerable children. In addition to money and food relief that they provide, they also offer access to health and education that they otherwise would not. ",4,0,20180824-122144_159_live
9,I see. What is your role with this charity?,4,1,20180824-122144_159_live

12,"Well actually you could donate without actually having to pay! Mturk is giving us a bonus, and we can choose to donate part of it right through Mturk! I think this is awesome, because too many organizations just care about getting the results that they're looking for (research). But at least this one is also doing some social good as well! Do you think you'd donate just $1 if it was given through Mturk like I mentioned?",6,0,20180824-122144_159_live

On accountability and transperancy, they're rated 97 out of 100, and for financial responsibility they're rated 84 out of 100. Not perfect, but still quite impressive. ",4,0,20180823-022522_183_live

1,Hi my name is Donna   what's yours?,0,1,20180829-101807_380_live
2,My name is Steven.  Do you actively donate to charity?  Have you ever heard of Save the Children?,1,0,20180829-101807_380_live
3,Sorry Steven  I saw your name after I asked.Yes I often monthly really donate to a charity in the Gobi .I have heard and at one point did activly donated to Save The Children.Thank you for asking,1,1,20180829-101807_380_live
4,Save the Children is a wonderful organization.  They promote children's rights and provide relief to support children in developing countries.  Many children around the world benefit from their work.,2,0,20180829-101807_380_live
5,Yes I agree do you donate to Save The Children? I would love to see the children taken from the trafficking aspect and returned to the families.,2,1,20180829-101807_380_live
6,I do donate to Save the Children and I agree with you that human trafficking is something we need to tackle.  It makes me sad that people including children are subjected to such horrors.  Why our world has to have such evil is beyond me.,3,0,20180829-101807_380_live
7,"It is called sin and we CAN do a lot about it by making Save the Children fully accountable for the finances we send ,accountability is very necessary to know where the money is going and if it is being used directly foe the child or administrative fees.",3,1,20180829-101807_380_live
8,I agree and Save the Children provides proof on how they spend their money.  You can view that information on their website.  You can also view reports created by independent resources proving they allocate funds as they say.,4,0,20180829-101807_380_live
9,This is good I also donated to Feed The Children and withdrew my donations when I checked with the accounting agency responsiable for the allocations of the fumds and only a small 10 cents ever went to the child the rest was what they called operating and administrative fees---I was quite angry as we had donated quite a lot.,4,1,20180829-101807_380_live
10,"Wow, that makes me angry when organizations conduct themselves that way.  I understand the need for costs and needing to use some of the money for that.  I like that Save the children specifically states that they use x amount of every dollar.  The financial audits back up their claim.  So I can rest assured that the value of my dollar is going to the children as they promise.",5,0,20180829-101807_380_live
11,So Steven are you going to donate today ?,5,1,20180829-101807_380_live
12,I plan to donate for sure.  I figure that half of my earnings would suffice.  It will help children and I will still benefit.  It seems like a proper thing to do.,6,0,20180829-101807_380_live
13,Sounds good to me I shall also donate 1/2 of my earnings as we are the voice of these precious children I pray they get clean drinking water good food medical treatment housing and all the needs met if we ALL pull together it can be a better world for these children.,6,1,20180829-101807_380_live
14,Looking at the Saving the Children foundation is appears they are doing extensive work in Africa.  What areas of the world do you think could benefit from this organization?,7,0,20180829-101807_380_live
15,Wow that's great what about right here in the USA?There are so many children in poverty here in West Virginia and the other impovished areas.I also see the need in the Gobi desert for good drinking water and medical care.,7,1,20180829-101807_380_live
16,"I agree, I hurt for all children facing bad conditions but in the United States we face a lot too.  It would be nice if they also had a allocation schedule for regions of the world.  By that I mean splitting the funding to include our country and specifically spelling out how much goes to each.f",8,0,20180829-101807_380_live
17,Is Save The Children only internationaly?We need to have a movement to help the children of our country as well as others  Africa has had so much drought and many deaths due to the heat  I am sure they are also in dire straights.,8,1,20180829-101807_380_live
18,It appears they do spend money the US during disasters or other impacting scenarios.  That is good to know.,9,0,20180829-101807_380_live
19,Oh o.k. but it is a disaster in many ways when our own children have no food clean drinking water decent housing but I do understand   so that being said what else do we need to discuss concerning donations?May I add that I was blessed to provid e 2 drinking wells for the Gobi desert and it was and is such a blesing to see the use where they can draw water for the families as well as the livestock  giving is a form of love in many ways.,9,1,20180829-101807_380_live

9,That is awesome. It is just really hard to donate when I have to think of my own family. Not easier to give money to other when I have bills that needs to come first and my own children to think about,4,1,20180829-080320_760_live
10,"I agree. I am also a parent and my family's needs have always come first. I have been able to set aside a very small donation for this organization by telling my kids that they can help another child who is not as fortunate as they are by contributing a small portion of their allowance each week. At first, of course there was grumbling but I showed them pictures of the kids they would be helping and they decided to help.",5,0,20180829-080320_760_live
11,That is very awesome. I don't pay my kids allowance so that wouldn't work for me. I tell them their allowance is the power to play on their tablet and the internet they use.,5,1,20180829-080320_760_live

18,The exact number i am unsure of to be honest. But i know for sure they are caring abd and legitimate.,9,0,20180829-010424_398_live
19,"I read recently in the news about an NGO with a similiar name that only donate like, 10 percent of the actual amount to charity. ",9,1,20180829-010424_398_live
20,Yes that is correct. But you do not have to do that much ,10,0,20180829-010424_398_live

11,Sounds like a good charity,5,1,20180829-092612_565_live
12,"I agree. Since they're run completely on donations, do you think you could spare $2 today to help them continue their mission?",6,0,20180829-092612_565_live
13,Yes I can,6,1,20180829-092612_565_live

11,"I think it's terrible, however donations wont directly fix the problems of this country. The governments involved need to come a peaceful resolution before this type of thing stops happening, and if their own government doesnt care enough to fix it how is my money suppose to change that ",5,1,20180829-055223_138_live
12,the donations to the correct people would help them rebuild things and rebuild lives,6,0,20180829-055223_138_live
13,Lives that would surely be displaced again by the terrible violence going on there,6,1,20180829-055223_138_live
14,and with the donations you are helping people relocate as well ,7,0,20180829-055223_138_live
15,"I still would choose not to donate, as of currently while tragic the tradgey of the situation being dire may be what needs to occur for the governments involved need to work towards peace instead of war",7,1,20180829-055223_138_live
16,So you would prefer that no aid goes to these suffering? ,8,0,20180829-055223_138_live
17,I think different types of aid is needed in this situation ,8,1,20180829-055223_138_live
18,and you do not think money would be helpful here? what about for food and rations,9,0,20180829-055223_138_live

1,"I'm doing well, just finished my dinner.  How about yourself?",0,1,20180829-161850_275_live
2,"Pretty good. So the researcher would like us to make a donation to Save the Children. It seems like a good cause, would you like to donate?",1,0,20180829-161850_275_live
3,Absolutely!  Do you know what Save the Children does as a charity?,1,1,20180829-161850_275_live
4,"Yeah, it promotes childrens rights and provides help and support for kids in developing countries. I always try to donate to charities for children",2,0,20180829-161850_275_live
5,"Gotcha, that sounds like a worthy cause.  How do you feel about donating all of the money?",2,1,20180829-161850_275_live
6,I'd be all for that. It might as well go to kids who are in need. So you would like to donate the full $2?,3,0,20180829-161850_275_live
7,"Yeah, let's go for it.  I'd rather kids in need get the money.  I'm trying to get into the habit of donating more these days, so this is a good way to start",3,1,20180829-161850_275_live
8,"That is awesome, we'll both have done our good deed for the day too",4,0,20180829-161850_275_live
9,Exactly!  Now I can sleep with a good conscience tonight haha,4,1,20180829-161850_275_live
10,haha thats right. So I looked at a little more info about the charity and apparently they helped a lot with Syrian children that were targets of violence,5,0,20180829-161850_275_live
11,"Oh man, now I wish I could donate more.  But I bet this 2 dollars will go a long way to helping those kids.  Every little bit counts!",5,1,20180829-161850_275_live
12,"Yeah, two dollars doesnt seem like much to us, but its probably a huge help for children in poverty",6,0,20180829-161850_275_live
13,It's horrifying to think about what those kids have been through.  I can't begin to imagine how they must feel right now.  It's not fair they are dealing with their situation at that age when all I was worrying about was who was the most popular kid in class.,6,1,20180829-161850_275_live
14,"I agree. Its hard to even think about living in a place that's violent, impoverished and where every day is difficult. It does make our problems seem pretty trivial",7,0,20180829-161850_275_live
15,"I stubbed my toe this morning and thought it was the worst thing ever.  Now, I don't feel that it was all that bad",7,1,20180829-161850_275_live
16,haha yeah really! I hope other people doing this study decide to donate all of their money too. That would be a lot of help!,8,0,20180829-161850_275_live
17,Seriously!  It'd be really neat to be able to see how many people donated to the cause,8,1,20180829-161850_275_live
18,"Agreed. Some researchers do send that info out after their studies (maybe they'll see our convo and do it!).  So I think that's our 10 messages. We're agreeing to donate the full amount, right?",9,0,20180829-161850_275_live

2,I'm really good.  I have three children in high school.  I always wanted more children and I think that is why I am so passionate about Save the Children.  Do you donate to any children's charities?,1,0,20180829-082505_548_live
3,"No, I have never donated to any children's charities. I usually donate to other causes.",1,1,20180829-082505_548_live
4,"Personally, I only donate to two causes.  I donate to a local Down Syndrome Organization and Save the Children.  I have found that many charities are making the organizers rich and the money doesn't always go toward causes I believe in.  Have you heard of Save the Children?",2,0,20180829-082505_548_live
5,I have only heard of Save the Children from doing HITs on mTurk.  Its a commonly referenced charity...so much so that I am convinced its not real lol,2,1,20180829-082505_548_live
6,"Lol!  I have seen it several times as well, but I assure you, it is real.  Donations to Save the Children ensure children's right to health, education and safety.  I prefer helping people in my own community, however, I feel that Save the Children is so important to children in the USA and other countries.  Today, I am only looking for a small donation.  Would you ever consider donating to an international organization?",3,0,20180829-082505_548_live

10,Sometimes I doubt what I see on mTurk too!  I wanted to assure you the organization is real.  Did you see that half of refugees are children and 77 cents a day can provide shelter for an entire family?,5,0,20180829-082505_548_live
11,Yeah I did.  Its hard to believe that so little can do so much!,5,1,20180829-082505_548_live
12,"When I saw that, it made me feel terrible.  Just yesterday I spent twice that on a fountain drink at a gas station.  I drank half of it and threw the rest away.  Did you have an amount you were thinking of donating?",6,0,20180829-082505_548_live
13,Yeah its amazing when you think about how much we waste in our day to day lives.  A dollar seems like a good amount to donate. ,6,1,20180829-082505_548_live

17,"OK, its just good to know that Save the Children is actually real",8,1,20180829-082505_548_live
18,I agree.  I always do mTurk hits as a way to save for a family vacation.  I rarely donate when they ask because I'm never sure they are real or if it's a way for the requester to save money.  Thank you so much for your donation and it was nice chatting with you!,9,0,20180829-082505_548_live

3,Okay. Sounds like a good way to raise some money.,1,1,20180829-055552_578_live

9,I donate to the charity twice a year already and today I would like to keep my full bonus.,4,1,20180829-055552_578_live
10,I completely understand and appreciate your past support. I would also like you to think about how your MTurk bonus could be put to good use in places like Syria and Myanmar where there are on going tragedies. You could do a lot of good with the additional donation today.,5,0,20180829-055552_578_live

13,Yes - I am sure that $2 dollars would be able to accomplish a lot more through Save the Children.,6,1,20180829-055552_578_live
14,"Not only that, but think about it in the bigger picture. When all MTurk workers contribute their bonus payment today, it adds up to a lot of money very quickly. While you may think your $2 is not that much, when it is put together with all the other generous donations from MTurk workers, it really adds up quickly.",7,0,20180829-055552_578_live
15,I didn't think about it like that. This is something to consider. It would be a nice-sized donation.,7,1,20180829-055552_578_live
16,It really would. Your $2 along with everyone else's can make a big difference in the lives of other people. Would you reconsider your earlier decision?,8,0,20180829-055552_578_live
17,"I don't think that I will donate anything today, sorry.",8,1,20180829-055552_578_live
18,Can I ask what you will be using your $2 for than? It seems like such a small amount that it should be easy to make the donation and not have it impact you greatly.,9,0,20180829-055552_578_live
19,It will be put into savings along with my other mturk money.,9,1,20180829-055552_578_live

8,Ok so let me tell you this. 0.50 cents would help so much but 0.60 would be even better.  Let me tell you why.   Millians of syrian children have grown up facing the threat of daily violence   In 2018 1000 children were killed in violence  A donation of 0.60 can address these problems,4,0,20180808-015530_429_live

7,I was just about to mention that I never really have donated to any organization. if there is one i support it would definately be this one. I am sure there are many ways to help,3,1,20180808-001810_178_live

9,"That is amazing!!! I will absolutely look to donating something later, just because I have always wanted to anyways and now this so why not. anything helps and It would make me feel better to know that I tried even if it not a big amount, I will donate what I can and continue.

10,Okay great. That sounds perfect. How much would you like to donate now? It could be any amount from $0 to what your payment for this task would be.,5,0,20180808-001810_178_live

1,I do not want to donate any of my reward for this hit.  I make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that I do.,0,1,20180808-032124_114_live
2,"Save the Children is a great international no-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. It has a very low overhead and almost all the money donated to it is directly used to help children.",1,0,20180808-032124_114_live
3,I know that it is a good organization and I support them.  However I am not getting a reward from this hit.  I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.  I want the money to do with as I choose.,1,1,20180808-032124_114_live
4,Save the Children has helped build hundreds of schools in developing nations around the world. They've educated many children who have gone on to do important medical and other life saving jobs.,2,0,20180808-032124_114_live

9,I do not want to make a donation today.,4,1,20180808-032124_114_live
10,Think about how you were probably going to just waste the measly reward amount you were being offered for this HIT on junk food or coffee and think about what amazing things Save the Children would be able to do with that money.,5,0,20180808-032124_114_live
11,I am not going to waste the reward.  I use it for things that my family needs.,5,1,20180808-032124_114_live
12,Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money. Your family is rich enough to live in a first world country and have food on a daily basis. By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer.,6,0,20180808-032124_114_live
13,We work for everything that we have.  Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.,6,1,20180808-032124_114_live
14,Of course you work for everything you own. By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood.,7,0,20180808-032124_114_live

10,"About 86.5%, the rest goes to staff and other infastructure.",5,0,20180830-232642_468_live
11,"That's not a bad percentage considering, but isn't non-profit supposed to be volunteers?",5,1,20180830-232642_468_live
12,"No, non-profits can have paid employees, and many charities when they reach a certain size need them to organize things.  Just that in non-profits, the compensation must be reasonable, and you can have passive investors that get paid who don't engage in any employment activities at the company.",6,0,20180830-232642_468_live
13,"That's interesting to learn. What is the funding for the children used for primarily? Housing, food, or schooling?",6,1,20180830-232642_468_live
14,"Yes, housing, food and schooling are definite priorities.  Save the Children also provides assistance to children that go through natural disasters or conflicts, along with protection from abuse, and access to healthcare.",7,0,20180830-232642_468_live
15,I like that! People don't usually think about protection from abuse and natural disaster relief. ,7,1,20180830-232642_468_live
16,"Yeah, they don't, and the US has had some natural disasters in the past few years.  Houston, TX being one last year. ",8,0,20180830-232642_468_live

0,Hello,0,0,20180830-154630_337_live
1,Hi,0,1,20180830-154630_337_live
2,So I am supposed to persuade you to donate all thirty of your cents to a charity called Save the Children,1,0,20180830-154630_337_live
3,"Oh, I believe I've heard of them. What kind of work do they do?",1,1,20180830-154630_337_live
4,"They promote childrens rights, provide relief and helps support children in developing countries",2,0,20180830-154630_337_live
5,Do you know if they keep track of the effectiveness of their interventions?,2,1,20180830-154630_337_live
6,I believe they do. They also help fund education for children,3,0,20180830-154630_337_live
7,"That sounds admirable. I usually donate to global health charities (like the Against Malaria Foundation) because it's highly cost effective. Policy intervention is also important, but it's harder to know if it's worthwhile/will be successful...",3,1,20180830-154630_337_live
8,Totally understandable. It is easier to donate to something when there is tangible evidence of its success. I think helping children have access to an education will be beneficial to the entire world in the long run,4,0,20180830-154630_337_live
9,"By the way, on my side I'm told I can donate anything from $0-$2. So donating $0.30 sounds reasonable.",4,1,20180830-154630_337_live
10,"I think that is very reasonable, and every little bit helps. ",5,0,20180830-154630_337_live
11,I would be interested to know what different programs their funding goes towards. Do they publish a budget?,5,1,20180830-154630_337_live
12,"They actually do, I just looked on their website. It has a lot of information that I didnt expect them to make public",6,0,20180830-154630_337_live

2,First let's start out with how was your day today?,1,0,20180830-181256_736_live
3,My day has been going great! I love living in the USA! It's the best country in the world!,1,1,20180830-181256_736_live
4,We do have a lot of freedom dont we?  Some others are not so fortunate though :(,2,0,20180830-181256_736_live
5,I feel ya. I sometimes wonder what could be done to fix the world's many problems.,2,1,20180830-181256_736_live
6,You and me both.  We just need some smarter people in charge.  We also need more people to help others that are not so fortunate.  Wouldn't you agree?,3,0,20180830-181256_736_live
7,I think that the government needs to do more to help other. I don't know what someone like me could do. I'm barely making it myself.,3,1,20180830-181256_736_live
8,I am also not doing the greatest with finances at the present moment.  Mturk is actually putting food on the table for me and my children.  But today you and I could make a difference.,4,0,20180830-181256_736_live

12,I have personally noticed many things in the last 10 years where the universe is someway connected and of course there are things that are not known to man or maybe not even be discovered.  But yeah we can make a little difference today and hopefully something good will happen.  Would you be interested in donating some or all of the money you would be getting from this task today?,6,0,20180830-181256_736_live
13,I wasn't planning on making a donation. I was hoping to use it for my household needs. ,6,1,20180830-181256_736_live
14,We can find another way.  There will be opportunities tonight yet.  If you donate an amount today I will match that donation.  Is that cool?,7,0,20180830-181256_736_live

11,okay lets do $1. ,5,1,20180901-112824_44_live

0,Hello how's it going?,0,0,20180901-071043_291_live
1,"I am doing well, how are you?",0,1,20180901-071043_291_live
2,"Decent, bit of a slow start to the morning on Turk but it is the weekend so I guess that's expected",1,0,20180901-071043_291_live
3,I'm new to this so I have no idea what to expect.  How long have you been doing it?,1,1,20180901-071043_291_live
4,I've been working this for almost two years now. The busier season is starting as the colleges in the US will be started/starting soon so that helps,2,0,20180901-071043_291_live
5,So obviously it's worth it for you.  Do you just do it in your spare time?,2,1,20180901-071043_291_live
6,Yea it's definitely worth it to me. I do some at my work on days when its slow but mostly just in my off time instead of going on social media or something I come here,3,0,20180901-071043_291_live
7,I guess it's a lot better way to waste time than seeing what a bunch of people I don't really care about are doing.  So when college is in there's less competition?  ,3,1,20180901-071043_291_live
8,Haha exactly! When college is in session we get more studies/surveys posted as a lot of the work on Turk is done for academic reasons. So in the next couple weeks we'll see an influx of students doing their psychology studies and such via the platform.,4,0,20180901-071043_291_live
9,"Oh man, I didn't even think of that.  They have all the grant money to throw out too.  So how much time do you throw at this in a given week?",4,1,20180901-071043_291_live
10,It varies but generally a few hours on my workdays and maybe like 6 or 8 on my days off I'd say,5,0,20180901-071043_291_live
11,That's pretty good.  I don't have that kind of time.  Any suggestions for a newcomer?,5,1,20180901-071043_291_live
12,"On the task page sort so you see the newest HITs, and grab whatever looks good to you as far as surveys. I'd recommend being wary of doing multiple HITs for any 1 requestor until you vet them yourself because rejections early on in a Turk account can make getting better hits tough (a lot of the better hits require 99% or higher approval rating) - and remember you'll get a lot faster at it as you keep going, it can feel a bit slow and tough at the beginning but it does get better",6,0,20180901-071043_291_live
13,"Thanks, the last few days have been pretty boring, I was hoping to see more progress.  Are sureveys the way to go?  I've seen a lot of the website searching stuff too?  Is that stuff worth it?",6,1,20180901-071043_291_live
14,"Website searching can be good, it never hurts to try a HIT once - see how fast you can complete it and decide if it\'s worth doing more from there. One other cool thing about MTurk is that some studies allow you to donate money to a charitable cause directly from the task payment - This one we\'re doing now in fact allows us to donate towards a foundation called ""Save the Children""",7,0,20180901-071043_291_live
15,Oh really?  Where do you see that?,7,1,20180901-071043_291_live
16,"At the end of the study they will ask if you'd like to donate from your payment to the foundation, they assist needy children all around the globe in dire situations. Would you be willing to donate any of your payment today to help save the kids?",8,0,20180901-071043_291_live
17,I think so.  How do you see where the donation goes?  ,8,1,20180901-071043_291_live
18,It will tell you in a short blurb above the box to donate (I've done this HIT before in the past) and the researchers ensure 100% of any amount you donate goes to the kids. Even a small donation makes a big difference because there are so many of us making small amounts that it really adds up!,9,0,20180901-071043_291_live
19,That's great.  Certainly something that needs to be done.  Have you had the opportunity to travel a lot?  I recently went to Africa and it gave me a new perspective on life.,9,1,20180901-071043_291_live
0,Hi! How are you? ,0,0,20180901-063841_657_live
1,Hi! Good morning,0,1,20180901-063841_657_live
2,Have you ever heard of Save the Children?,1,0,20180901-063841_657_live
3,"Yeah, they help kids don't they?  Like in Syria?",1,1,20180901-063841_657_live
4,Yup. They promote children's rights and help support children in developing countries,2,0,20180901-063841_657_live
5,"I always wonder if programs like that use too much of what they get for ""administrative"" costs.",2,1,20180901-063841_657_live
6,"Yeah, some organizations probably spend a lot on that. In 2017, 86% of Save the Children's expenditures went to program services",3,0,20180901-063841_657_live
7,"OH! That's a great ratio, (or percentage). ",3,1,20180901-063841_657_live
8,Yeah! It's ranked really highly among other nonprofit organizations. Their independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars they spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. They keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.,4,0,20180901-063841_657_live
9,I'm delighted to learn that! ,4,1,20180901-063841_657_live
10,"Yes! They've helped 157 million children in 120 countries. Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. When you focus on children in rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Through Save the Children's education, protection and emergency programs, they reached 638,000 kids in 2016 alone.",5,0,20180901-063841_657_live
11,You've hit on one of my concerns.  I worry about American children (since I live there). But it's not just rural kids who have needs.  Children in urban areas are sometimes at risk as well. Does Save the Children address that area?,5,1,20180901-063841_657_live
12,"That's definitely true. Save the Children targets America's most isolated and underserved children. 20% of children in the US grows up in poverty; of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural, which is why rural America is a focus for this organization. It doesn't mean that children in urban areas aren't important too, of course!",6,0,20180901-063841_657_live
13,That's true. Every child matters and every child's parent(s) too! I love the wonder that kids have for almost everything! And they can't experience joy if their bellies are empty.,6,1,20180901-063841_657_live
14,"That's so true. It's great to feel like we have the power to make a difference in kids' lives by donating to organizations like Save the Children! Would you like to donate to the charity now to help kids get the food, education, help, and support that they need to thrive? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.",7,0,20180901-063841_657_live
15,"I think I'd like to donate, but I'd like to do it on my own. Is there a website I can do so?",7,1,20180901-063841_657_live
16,"Donating here is a really easy way to do it - you can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2). The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children. Of course, you can donate on your own too! Their website is  URL ",8,0,20180901-063841_657_live
17,"Hmm, okay, I would donate both places, I think.",8,1,20180901-063841_657_live
18,Awesome! I am going to do the same.  How much of your task payment would you like to donate to the charity now?,9,0,20180901-063841_657_live

1,"It's a nonprofit, thats about it. Why?,",0,1,20180901-001917_173_live

6,"Very understandable. I tend to research before investing time or money into any endeavor to be honest.

5,"United States. I think it's a good cause but I would need more information about it before contributing a lot of money. I'd want to know what exactly they do and how they help the kids, how the money is distributed, how they select the children, etc.",2,1,20180901-161656_635_live
6,I totally get it.  It's non-government at least.  Last year they helped kids in Bangladesh who were refugees.  I think they see where there is a need and step in - so larger groups of children.,3,0,20180901-161656_635_live

12,"Our family sponsors a child, and it gives us a good sense of ""giving back"".  It\'s why I asked where you are from.  I feel like in America we have so much!!!  It feels like we are helping more than ourselves and the people around us when we give internationally.",6,0,20180901-161656_635_live

4,"Well, I'm here to talk about Save the Children. It's a charity.",2,0,20180901-160047_444_live
5,OK. What exactly does the charity do to save children?,2,1,20180901-160047_444_live
6,"It's an international, nongovernmental agency that promotes children's rights in developing countries.",3,0,20180901-160047_444_live
7,"So it's not an aid-type of charity, but more like legal work?",3,1,20180901-160047_444_live
8,"No. It helps with education and food, especially for kids in war-torn countries.",4,0,20180901-160047_444_live
9,So it sends food and books to these countries?,4,1,20180901-160047_444_live
10,"Yes. It has great credentials. That's something that's important to me, especially as I have limited amounts to donate.",5,0,20180901-160047_444_live
11,So Charity Navigator gives it a good rating? Don't want to support one that spends a lot on administrative or fundraising costs.,5,1,20180901-160047_444_live
12,"I agree with you! It doesn't spend a lot on administrative costs. I'm very particular about that, too.",6,0,20180901-160047_444_live
13,What percentage of donations go to the actual countries then?,6,1,20180901-160047_444_live
14,I'm going to have to look that up. Give me a sec.,7,0,20180901-160047_444_live
15,No problem. Also curious how much they gave out in past year or so.,7,1,20180901-160047_444_live
16,86% goes to program services. I'm going to donate $1 of my earnings on this HIT. It's less than the cost of a cup of coffee these days.,8,0,20180901-160047_444_live
17,What countries have they given money too?,8,1,20180901-160047_444_live
18,Syria is a big one. There are kids that are under the daily threat of violence. Mainly developing countries in war zones.,9,0,20180901-160047_444_live
19,I'll probably look in to the charity a little more before deciding to donate.,9,1,20180901-160047_444_live
20,Think about donating a little bit of your HIT.  50 cents?,10,0,20180901-160047_444_live
21,"50 cents isn't going to help much, but I like to make sure any money I give is well spent.",10,1,20180901-160047_444_live

5,"Interesting, in how many countries do they work?",2,1,20180901-075346_269_live
6,Right now they are in 120 countries and have helped 33.3 million children directly. I am partial to children's charities because they help the ones who can't really help themselves.,3,0,20180901-075346_269_live

9,I've heard about it. It breaks my heart. is this organization clear with its financial reports?,4,1,20180901-075346_269_live
10,"Yes in fact the most recent rating of Save the Children by a non profit charity watchdog gave it an ""A"". I think that is pretty clear.",5,0,20180901-075346_269_live
11,That is so good to find a trustworthy charities. I think there should be a few well-known companies cooperating with this charity,5,1,20180901-075346_269_live
12,"I agree. I think more people need to get on board to help the children. If we all do a little by sacrificing that 1 coffee a week or by eating out one time less per week, we could all make more of a difference, right?",6,0,20180901-075346_269_live
13,"right, every little help make a big difference. we can support a family with few dollars in some countries",6,1,20180901-075346_269_live

9,"Internet research is a good way to learn about pretty much anything. It's hard to come up with a bunch of conversation about charity. It's easy to just live in your own world and not think about the horrible things in the world. Charity is a good way to get a collective group of people to make a change in the world.

17,Childrens charities are important to increase awareness for diseases and disabilities. I cant even imagine what these poor families go through.

3,I'm pretty poor.  If I have money I try to donate to charities that I like.,1,1,20180827-050740_909_live

5,No.  I don't believe I have.,2,1,20180827-050740_909_live

13,That would be real low on my list of priorities.  People that demand perfect victims can donate to children's charities; I don't do that.,6,1,20180827-050740_909_live
14,Well i hear you. I think that any donation to anyone is helpful in this world. It should be specialized,7,0,20180827-050740_909_live
15,I prefer to prioritize charities where lots of people don't like the victims.  Most people (unlike me) seem to like children so those charities don't have any trouble.,7,1,20180827-050740_909_live
